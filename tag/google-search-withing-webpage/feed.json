Because Programmable Search Engine is based on Google’s core search technology, you can be confident that your users are getting high quality, relevant results. You can customize a lot of your search engine, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apply your site’s look and feel to the search box and results page</li>\n<li>Use search features such as refinements, autocomplete, and promotions to enhance your users’ search experience</li>\n<li>Understand your users’ behavior by linking your search engine with  <a href=\"https://google.com/analytics/\">Google Analytics</a></li>\n<li>Make money from your search engine with  <a href=\"https://google.com/adsense\">Google AdSense</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"Demo\"><a href=\"#Demo\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"Demo:\"></a>Demo:</h3><script async src=\"https://cse.google.com/cse.js?cx=4269bf6b77dbf4cae\">\n</script>\n<div class=\"gcse-search\"></div>\n\n<hr>\n<h3 id=\"How-is-Programmable-Search-Engine-different-from-Google-Web-Search\"><a href=\"#How-is-Programmable-Search-Engine-different-from-Google-Web-Search\" class=\"headerlink\" title=\"How is Programmable Search Engine different from Google Web Search?\"></a>How is Programmable Search Engine different from Google Web Search?</h3><p>You have the option to set your custom search engine to search the entire web, similar to a normal search on Google.com. However, you might notice some differences. Your custom search engine:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Emphasizes your results over anything else on the web</li>\n<li>Doesn’t include some  <a href=\"https://support.google.com/websearch#topic=3378866\">Google Web Search features</a>, such as personalized results</li>\n<li>May have a subset of results from the Google index if you include more than ten sites</li>\n</ul>\n",
