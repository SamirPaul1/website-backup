Single Sign-On (SSO) is a centralized authentication mechanism that allows users to access multiple applications or services with a single set of credentials. The idea behind SSO is to simplify the process of logging in to various systems, so that users only have to remember one username and password.

With SSO, when a user logs in to one application or service, they are automatically logged in to all of the other systems and applications that are part of the SSO solution. This eliminates the need for the user to enter their credentials for each individual system, reducing the risk of forgotten passwords, password fatigue, and other security-related issues.

There are different SSO technologies, including SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language), Kerberos, and OAuth/OpenID Connect. Each of these technologies has its own strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the organization.

In summary, SSO is a centralized authentication mechanism that allows users to access multiple applications and services with a single set of credentials, reducing the risk of forgotten passwords and improving security. SSO provides a convenient and secure way to manage access to resources, making it a popular choice for many organizations.
