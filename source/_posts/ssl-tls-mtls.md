SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), TLS (Transport Layer Security), and mTLS (Mutual TLS) are all security protocols used to secure communications over the internet.

SSL was the original protocol used to secure internet communications, but it has been largely replaced by TLS, which is considered to be more secure. TLS is a cryptographic protocol that provides secure communication between two endpoints, such as a web server and a client browser. It ensures that the data transmitted between the endpoints is confidential and integrity protected.

mTLS, also known as Mutual TLS, is an extension of TLS that adds an extra layer of security by requiring both the client and server to present a valid certificate to each other. This provides a stronger level of identity validation and protects against man-in-the-middle attacks. mTLS is used in situations where it is important to ensure the authenticity of both parties involved in a communication, such as in financial transactions or sensitive data transfers.

In summary, SSL, TLS, and mTLS are all protocols used to secure internet communications, with TLS being the most widely used and considered to be the most secure. mTLS adds an extra layer of security by requiring both the client and server to present a valid certificate to each other, providing a stronger level of identity validation and protection against man-in-the-middle attacks.
