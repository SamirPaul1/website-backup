<h2>451. Sort Characters By Frequency</h2><h3>Medium</h3><hr><div><p>Given a string, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters.</p>

<p><b>Example 1:</b>
</p><pre><b>Input:</b>
"tree"

<b>Output:</b>
"eert"

<b>Explanation:</b>
'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'. Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
</pre>
<p></p>

<p><b>Example 2:</b>
</p><pre><b>Input:</b>
"cccaaa"

<b>Output:</b>
"cccaaa"

<b>Explanation:</b>
Both 'c' and 'a' appear three times, so "aaaccc" is also a valid answer.
Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
</pre>
<p></p>

<p><b>Example 3:</b>
</p><pre><b>Input:</b>
"Aabb"

<b>Output:</b>
"bbAa"

<b>Explanation:</b>
"bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
</pre>
<p></p></div>
