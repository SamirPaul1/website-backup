OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect are both open standards for authorization and authentication on the web. They are used to control access to resources, such as APIs, and to verify the identity of users.

OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that enables a third-party application to obtain limited access to an HTTP service on behalf of a resource owner, without requiring the resource owner to reveal its credentials. OAuth 2.0 provides a secure way for a user to grant access to their resources to a third-party application, without the need for the user to share their password with the application. OAuth 2.0 is used by many popular web applications, including Google, Facebook, and Twitter, to allow users to authenticate and authorize access to their resources.

OpenID Connect is a simple identity layer built on top of OAuth 2.0. It provides a secure way to authenticate users and verify their identities, while also providing information about the user's identity to the client. OpenID Connect enables the client to know that the user is who they claim to be, without having to manage passwords or other sensitive information. It provides a single sign-on solution, allowing users to authenticate once and then access multiple applications without having to log in again. OpenID Connect is used by many organizations to provide a secure and easy way for their users to authenticate and access resources.

In summary, OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework used to control access to resources, while OpenID Connect is a simple identity layer built on top of OAuth 2.0 that provides a secure way to authenticate users and verify their identities. Both OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect are widely used and provide a secure and flexible way to control access to resources and authenticate users on the web.
