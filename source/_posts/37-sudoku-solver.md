<h2><a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/sudoku-solver/">37. Sudoku Solver</a></h2><h3>Hard</h3><hr><div><p>Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.</p>

<p>A sudoku solution must satisfy <strong>all of the following rules</strong>:</p>

<ol>
	<li>Each of the digits <code>1-9</code> must occur exactly once in each row.</li>
	<li>Each of the digits <code>1-9</code> must occur exactly once in each column.</li>
	<li>Each of the digits <code>1-9</code> must occur exactly once in each of the 9 <code>3x3</code> sub-boxes of the grid.</li>
</ol>

<p>The <code>'.'</code> character indicates empty cells.</p>

'''    
Time complexity: O(9^(n*n)). For every unassigned index, there are 9 possible options so the time complexity is O(9^(n*n)). The time complexity remains the same but checking if a number is safe to use is much faster, O(1).
Space Complexity: O(n*n). As in worst case there can be n*n "." so to update them in board we need to use this space.
