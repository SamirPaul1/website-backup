description</span><a href="#111-a-nuts-and-bolts-description" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>The Internet is a computer networks that interconnects hundreds of millions of computing devices through the world. Today not only computers and workstation are being connected to the network, therefore the term <em>computer network</em> may sound a bit dated.</p><p>All the devices connected to the Internet are called <strong>hosts</strong> or <strong>end systems</strong>. End systems are connected together by a network of <strong>communication links</strong> and <strong>packets switches</strong>.</p><p>Different links can transmit data at different rates, with the <strong>transmission rate</strong> of a link measured in bits/second.</p><p>When one end system has data to send to another end system, the sending end system <em>segments</em> the data and adds <em>header bytes</em> to each segment. The resulting packages of information, called <strong>packets</strong>, are then sent through the network to the destination and system where they a reassembled into the original data.</p><p>A packet switch takes a packet arriving on one of its incoming communication links and forwards that packet on one of its outgoing communication links. The two most prominent types of packets switches are <strong>routers</strong> and <strong>link switches</strong>. The sequence of communication links and packet switches traversed by a packet from the sending end system to the receiving end system is known as <strong>route</strong> or <strong>path</strong>.</p><p>End systems access the Internet through <strong>Internet Service Providers (ISPs)</strong>, including residential ISPs (cable or phone company), corporate, university ISPs … Each ISP in itself is a network of packet switches and communication links. <em>Lower tier</em> (which interconnect end-systems) ISPs are interconnected through national and international <em>upper tier</em> ISP. An upper-tier ISP consists of high speed routers interconnected with high-speed fiber-optic links. Each ISP network is managed independently.</p><p>End systems, packet switches and other pieces of the Internet run <strong>protocols</strong> that control the sending and receiving of information within the Internet.</p><h3 id="112-a-services-description"><span class="me-2">1.1.2 A Services Description</span><a href="#112-a-services-description" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>The Internet can be described as <em>an infrastructure that provides services to applications</em>. These applications (Web, social networks, VoIP…) are said to be <strong>distributed</strong> since they involve multiple end systems that exchange data with each other. <strong>Internet applications run on end systems, not in the packet switches or routers</strong>, packet switches facilitate the exchange of data, but they are not concerned with the application that is the source or sink of data.</p><p>End systems attached to the Internet provide and <strong>Application Programming Interface (API)</strong> that specifies how a program running on one end system asks the Internet infrastructure to deliver data to a specific destination program running on another end system.</p><h3 id="113-what-is-a-protocol"><span class="me-2">1.1.3 What Is a Protocol?</span><a href="#113-what-is-a-protocol" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>All the activity in the Internet that involves two or more communicating remote entities is governed by a protocol.</p><p><strong>A protocol defines the format and the order of messages exchanged between two or more communicating entities, as weel as the actions taken on the trasmission and/or receipt of a message or other event</strong></p><h2 id="12-the-network-edge"><span class="me-2">1.2 The Network Edge</span><a href="#12-the-network-edge" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Computers and other devices connected to the Internet are often referred to as <em>end systems</em> as they sit at the edge of the Internet. They are also called <em>hosts</em> as they host, run, applications programs such as a Web Browser or an email client.</p><p>Hosts are sometimes further divided into two categories: <em>clients</em> and <em>servers</em>. The former being desktop, mobile pcs, smartphones, the latter being powerful machines that store and distribute Web pages, streams… Nowadays most of the servers reside in large <em>data centers</em></p><h3 id="121-access-networks"><span class="me-2">1.2.1 Access Networks</span><a href="#121-access-networks" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>They are the networks that physically connect end systems to the first router on a path from the end system to any other distant end system. Examples: mobile network, national or global ISP, local or regional ISP, home networks enterprise networks.</p><h4 id="home-access-dsl-cable-fith-dial-up-and-satellite"><span class="me-2">Home Access: DSL, Cable, FITH, Dial-Up and Satellite</span><a href="#home-access-dsl-cable-fith-dial-up-and-satellite" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>Today, the two most prevalent types of broadband residential access are <strong>digital subscriber line (DSL)</strong> and <strong>cable</strong>.</p><p>A residence typically obtains DSL access from the telephone company (telco) that provides its wired local phone access. The customer’s telco is therefore its ISP. DSL modem use the existing telephone lines to exchange data with DSLAMs (digital subscriber line access multiplexer) located in the telco local central office. The DSL modem takes digital data and translates it to high-frequency tones for transmission over telephone wires, these analog signals from many houses are translated back into digital format at the DSLAM. The use of different frequencies allows the phone line to carry a high-speed downstream channel, a medium-speed upstream channel and an ordinary two-way telephone channel. Hundreds or even thousands of households connect to a single DSLAM.</p><p>DSL: 24 Mbps downstream and 2.5 Mbps upstream (MAX VALUES). Because of the difference between these two values, the access is said to be <strong>asymmetric</strong>.</p><p><strong>Cable Internet</strong> access makes use of the cable television company’s existing cable television infrastructure. Cable modems connect to CMTS (Cablem Modem Termination System) which does the same job the DSLAM does for phone lines. The access is typically asymmetric. CABLE: 42.8 Mbps downstream and 30.7 Mbps upstream (MAX VALUES). Cable Internet access is a shared broadcast medium: each packet travels downstream on every link to every home and viceversa. For this, if several users are simultaneously using the downstream channel, the actual rate will be significantly lower.</p><p>Another up-and-coming technology that promises very high speeds is <strong>fiber to the home (FTTH)</strong>. The concept is simple: provide an optical fiber path from the Central Office (CO)</p><h4 id="access-in-the-enterprise-and-the-home-ethernet-and-wifi"><span class="me-2">Access in the Enterprise and the Home: Ethernet and WiFi</span><a href="#access-in-the-enterprise-and-the-home-ethernet-and-wifi" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>On corporate and university campuses, and increasingly in home settings, a <strong>Local Area Network (LAN)</strong> is used to connect an end system to the edge router. Ethernet is by far the most prevalent access technology is corporate, university and home networks. Ethernet uses twisted-pair copper wire to connect to an Ethernet switch which is connected into the larger Internet. The Internet is increasingly accessed wirelessly: wireless users transmit/receive packets to/from an access point connected into the enterprise’s network which in turn is connected to the wired Internet.</p><h4 id="wide-area-wireless-access-3g-and-lte"><span class="me-2">Wide-Area Wireless Access: 3G and LTE</span><a href="#wide-area-wireless-access-3g-and-lte" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>Smartphones and Tablets employ the same wireless infrastructure used for cellular telephony to send/receive packets through a base station operated by the cellular network provider. Third generation (3G) wireless and fourth generation (4G) of wide-area network are being deployed. LTE (“Long-Term Evolution”) has its root in 3G and can potentially achieve rates in excess of 10 Mbps.</p><h3 id="122-physical-media"><span class="me-2">1.2.2 Physical Media</span><a href="#122-physical-media" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>The book talks about it in detail but we haven’t talked about it in class</p><p>A bit, when traveling from source to destination, passes through a series of transmitter-receiver pairs, for each pair, the bit is sent by propagating electromagnetic waves or optical pulses across a <strong>physical medium</strong>. This can take many shapes and forms and doesn’t have to be of the same type for each transmitter-receiver pair along the path. Physical media fall into two categories:</p><ul><li><strong>guided media</strong>: the waves are guided along a solid medium (fiber-optic cable, twisted-pair copper wire, coaxial cable)<li><strong>unguided media</strong>: the waves propagate in the atmosphere and in outer space (wireless LAN, digital satellite channel)</ul><h2 id="13-the-network-core"><span class="me-2">1.3 The Network Core</span><a href="#13-the-network-core" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><h3 id="131-packet-switching"><span class="me-2">1.3.1 Packet Switching</span><a href="#131-packet-switching" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>In a network application, end systems exchange <strong>messages</strong> with each other. To send a message from a source end system to a destination end system, the source breaks long messages into smaller chunks of data known as <strong>packets</strong>. Between source and destination, each packet travels through communication links and <strong>packet switches</strong> (for which there are two predominant types, <strong>routers</strong> and <strong>link-layer switches</strong>). Packets are transmitted over each communication link at a rate equal to the <em>full</em> transmission rate of the link. So, if a source end system or a packet switch is send a packet of L bits over a link with transmission rate R bits/sec, then the time to transmit the packet is L/R seconds.</p><h4 id="store-and-forward-transmission"><span class="me-2">Store-and-forward Transmission</span><a href="#store-and-forward-transmission" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>Most packet switches use <strong>store-and-forward transmission</strong> at the inputs to the links. Store-and-forward transmission means that the packet switch must receive the entire packet before it can begin to transmit the first bit of the packet onto the outbound link. The link must <strong>buffer</strong> (“store”) the packet’s bits and only after the router has received all of the packet’s bits can it begin to transmit (“forward”) the packet onto the outbound link.</p><h4 id="queuing-delays-and-packet-loss"><span class="me-2">Queuing Delays and Packet Loss</span><a href="#queuing-delays-and-packet-loss" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>Each packet switch has multiple links attached to it. For each attached link, the packet switch has an <strong>output buffer</strong> (or <strong>output queue</strong>) which stores packets that the router is about to send into that link. If an arriving packet needs to be transmitted onto a link but finds the link busy with the transmission of another packet, the arriving packet must wait in the output buffer. Thus, packets suffer output buffer <strong>queuing delays</strong> which are variable and depend on the level of congestion in the network. Since the amount of buffer space is finite, an arriving packet may find the buffer completely full. In this case, <strong>packet loss</strong> will occur, either the arriving packet or one of the already queued packets will be dropped.</p><h4 id="forwarding-tables-and-routing-protocols"><span class="me-2">Forwarding tables and routing protocols</span><a href="#forwarding-tables-and-routing-protocols" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>In the Internet, every end system has an address called an IP address. When a source end system wants to send a packet to a destination end system, the source includes the destination’s IP address in the packet’s header. Each router has a <strong>forwarding table</strong> that maps destination addresses (or portions of the destination addresses) to that router’s outbound links. When a packet arrives at the router, the router examines the address and searches its forwarding table, using this destination address, to find the appropriate outbound link. A number of special <strong>routing protocols</strong> are used to automatically set the forwarding tables.</p><h3 id="132-circuit-switching"><span class="me-2">1.3.2 Circuit Switching</span><a href="#132-circuit-switching" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>In circuit-switched networks, the resources needed along a path(buffers, link transmission rate) to provide for communication between the end systems are <strong>reserved</strong> for the duration of the communication sessions. When two hosts want to communicate, the network establishes a <strong>dedicated end-to-end connection</strong> between them.</p><h4 id="multiplexing-in-circuit-switched-networks"><span class="me-2">Multiplexing in Circuit-Switched Networks</span><a href="#multiplexing-in-circuit-switched-networks" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>A circuit in a link is implemented with either <strong>frequency-division multiplexing (FDM)</strong> or <strong>time-division multiplexing (TDM)</strong>. With FDM, the frequency spectrum of a link is divided up among the connections established across the link. The width of the band is called the <strong>bandwidth</strong>. For a TDM link, time is divided into frames of fixed duration, and each frame is divided into a fixed number of time slots.</p><h4 id="packet-switching-versus-circuit-switching"><span class="me-2">Packet Switching Versus Circuit Switching</span><a href="#packet-switching-versus-circuit-switching" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>Packet switching is more flexible, uses resources efficiently and is simpler to implement (even if it requires congestion control). Circuit switching offers performance guarantees but uses resources inefficiently</p><h3 id="133-a-network-of-networks"><span class="me-2">1.3.3 A Network of Networks</span><a href="#133-a-network-of-networks" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>To create the Internet, ISPs must be interconnected, thus creating a <em>network of networks</em>. Much of the evolution of the structure of the Internet is driven by economics and national policy, rather than by performance consideration.</p><p>Today’s Internet is complex, consisting of a dozen or so tier-1 ISPs and hundreds of thousands of lower-tier ISPs. The ISPs are diverse in their coverage, with some spanning multiple continents and oceans, and others limited to narrow geographic regions. The lower-tier ISPs connect to the higher-tier ISPs and the higher-tier ISPs interconnect with one another.

This simplification itself is of considerable value by providing <em>modularity</em>, making it much easier to change the implementation of the service provided by the layer: as long as the layer provides the same service to the layer above it, and uses the same services from the layer below it, the remainder of the system remains unchanged when a layer’s implementation is changed.</p><h4 id="protocol-layering"><span class="me-2">Protocol Layering</span><a href="#protocol-layering" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>To provide structure to the design of network protocols, the network designers organize protocols in <strong>layers</strong>. <strong>Each protocol belongs to one of the layers</strong>. We are interested in the <strong>services</strong> that a layer offers to the layer above, <strong>service model</strong> of a layer. When taken together, the protocols of the various layers are called the <strong>protocol stack</strong>. The Internet protocol stack consists of five layers:</p><ul><li>Application<li>Transport<li>Network<li>Link<li>Physical</ul><h5 id="application-layer"><span class="me-2">Application Layer</span><a href="#application-layer" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h5><p>Where network applications and their applications-layer protocols reside. The Internet’s application layer includes many protocols: HTTP, SMTP, FTP, DNS. An application-layer protocol is distributed over multiple end systems, with the application in one end system using the protocol to exchange packets of information with the application in another end system. This packet of information at the application layer is called <strong>message</strong>.</p><h5 id="transport-layer"><span class="me-2">Transport Layer</span><a href="#transport-layer" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h5><p>It transports application-layer messages between application endpoints. In the Internet there are two transport protocols: TCP and UDP. TCP provides a connection-oriented service to its application: the service includes guaranteed delivery of application-layer messages to the destination and flow control unit. TCP also breaks long messages into shorter segments and provides a <strong>congestion-control mechanism</strong>, so that a source throttles its transmission rate when the network is congested. HTTP and SMTP use TCP</p><p>UDP provides a connectionless service to its applications: it’s a no-frills service that provides no guarantees, no reliability, no flow control and no congestion control. A transport-layer packet is called <strong>segment</strong> Skype uses UDP (speed required)</p><h5 id="network-layer"><span class="me-2">Network Layer</span><a href="#network-layer" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h5><p>It is responsible for moving network-layer packets known as <strong>datagrams</strong> from one host to another. The Internet’s network layer includes the IP Protocol. There is only one IP Protocol and all the Internet components that have a network layer must run it. The Internet’s network layer also contains routing protocols that determine the routes that datagrams take between sources and destinations. The Internet has many routing protocols. Often it is simply referred to as the IP protocols, forgetting that it includes routing too.</p><h5 id="link-layer"><span class="me-2">Link Layer</span><a href="#link-layer" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h5><p>To move a packet from one node to the next, the network layer relies on the services of the link layer. The services provided by the link layer depend on the specific link-layer protocol that is employed over the link. Examples are Ethernet, WiFi. We will refer to the link-layer packets as <strong>frames</strong></p><h5 id="physical-layer"><span class="me-2">Physical Layer</span><a href="#physical-layer" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h5><p>The job of the physical layer is to move the individual bits within the frame from one node to the next.

The transport layer then adds its own header and passes the datagram to the link layer which adds it own link-layer header information. Thus, we see that at each layer, a packet has two types of fields: <strong>header fields</strong> and a <strong>payload field</strong>, the payload typically being the packet from the layer above.</p><p>The process of encapsulation can be more complex: for example a large message may be divided into multiple transport-layer segments, which will be divided into multiple datagrams….</p><h2 id="16-networks-under-attack"><span class="me-2">1.6 Networks Under Attack</span><a href="#16-networks-under-attack" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><h3 id="malware"><span class="me-2">Malware</span><a href="#malware" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Along with all the good files we exchange on the Internet, come malicious software, collectively known as <strong>malware</strong> that can also enter and infect our devices.

The <strong>application architecture</strong>, on the other hand, is chosen by him. In choosing the application architecture, a developer will likely draw one of the two predominant architectural paradigms used in modern network applications:</p><ul><li><strong>Client-server architecture</strong>: there is an always on host, called the <em>server</em> which serves requests from many other hosts, called <em>clients</em>: [Web Browser and Web Server]. Clients do not communicate directly with each other. The server has a fixed, well-known address, called an IP address that clients use to connect to him. Often, a single server host is incapable of keeping up with all the requests from clients, for this reason, a <strong>data center</strong>, housing a large number of hosts, is often used to create a powerful virtual server (via <em>proxyin</em>).<li><strong>P2P architecture</strong>: there is minimal or no reliance on dedicated servers in data centers, the application exploits direct communication between pairs of intermittently connected bots, called <em>peers</em>. They are end systems owned and controlled by users. [Bittorrent, Skype]. P2P applications provide <strong>self-scalability</strong> (the network load is distributed) They are also <strong>cost-effective</strong> since they don’t require significant infrastructure and server bandwidth. P2P face challenges:<ol><li>ISP Friendly (asymmetric nature of residential ISPs)<li>Security<li>Incentives (convincing users to participate)</ol></ul><p>Some applications have hybrid architectures, such as for many instant messaging applications: a server keeps track of the IP addresses of users, but user-to-user messages are sent directly between users.</p><h3 id="212-processes-communicating"><span class="me-2">2.1.2 Processes Communicating</span><a href="#212-processes-communicating" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>In the jargon of operating systems, it’s not programs but <strong>processes</strong> that communicate. A process can be thought of as a program that is running within an end system. Processes on two different end systems communicate with each other by exchanging <strong>messages</strong> across the computer network: a sending process creates and sends messages into the network, a receiving process receives these messages and possibly responds by sending messages back.</p><h4 id="client-and-server-processes"><span class="me-2">Client and Server Processes</span><a href="#client-and-server-processes" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>A network application consists of pairs of processes that send messages to each other over a network.

The application developer has control of everything on the application-layer of the socket but has little control of the transport-layer side of the socket. The only control that he has over the transport-layer is:</p><ol><li>The choice of the transport protocol<li>Perhaps the ability to fix a few transport-layer parameters such as maximum buffer and maximum segment sizes</ol><h4 id="addressing-processes"><span class="me-2">Addressing Processes</span><a href="#addressing-processes" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>In order for a process running on one host to send packets to a process running on another host, the receiving process needs to have an address.

It is not a third protocol, but an enhancement of TCP, <strong>the enhancement being implemented in the application layer</strong> in both the client and the server side of the application (highly optimized libraries exist).

A <strong>Web page</strong> (or document) consists of objects. An <strong>object</strong> is simply a file (HTML file, jpeg image…) that is <em>addressable by a single URL</em>. Most Web pages consist of a <strong>base HTML file</strong> and several referenced objects. The HTML file references the other objects in the page with the objects’ URLs. Each URL has two components: the hostname of the server that houses the object and the object’s path name. <strong>Web Browsers</strong> implement the client side of HTTP. <strong>HTTP</strong> uses TCP as its underlying transport protocol.

When this is happening over TCP, the developer must take an important decision: should each request/response pair be sent over a <em>separate</em> TCP connection or should all of the requests and their corresponding responses be sent over the <em>same</em> TCP connection? In the former approach, the application is said to use <strong>non-persistent connections</strong> and in the latter it is said to use <strong>persistent connections</strong> By default HTTP uses non-persistent connections but can be configured to be use persistent connections. To estimate the amount of time that elapses when a client requests the base HTML file until the entire file is received by the client we define the <strong>round-trip time</strong> (<strong>RTT</strong>) which is the time it takes for a small packet to travel from client to server and then back to the client.</p><h4 id="http-with-non-persistent-connections"><span class="me-2">HTTP with Non-Persistent Connections</span><a href="#http-with-non-persistent-connections" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>For the page and each object it contains, a TCP connection must be opened (handshake request, handshake answer), we therefore observe an addition RTT, and for each object we will have a request followed by the reply This model can be expensive on the server side: a new connection needs to be established for each requested object, for each connection a TCP buffer must be allocated along some memory to store TCP variables.</p><h4 id="http-with-persistent-connections"><span class="me-2">HTTP with Persistent Connections</span><a href="#http-with-persistent-connections" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>The server leaves the TCP connection open after sending a response, subsequent requests and responses between the same client and server will be sent over the same connection.

When the server receives back-to-back requests, it sends the objects back-to-back.

Peers in a torrent download equal-size <em>chunks</em> of the file from one another with a typical chunk size of 256 KBytes. At the beginning a peer has no chunks, it accumulates more and more chunks over time. While it downloads chunks it also uploads chunks to other peers. Once a peer has acquired the entire file it may leave the torrent or remain in it and continue to upload chunks to other peers (becoming a <em>seeder</em>). Any peer can leave the torrent at any time and later rejoin it at anytime as well.</p><p>Each torrent has an infrastructure node called a <em>tracker</em>: when a peer joins a torrent, it registers itself with the tracker and periodically informs it that it is still in the torrent. The tracker keeps track of the peers participating in the torrent. A torrent can have up to thousands of peers participating at any instant of time.</p><p>User joins the torrent, the tracker randomly selects a subset of peers from the set of participating peers. User establishes concurrent TCP connections with all of these peers, called <em>neighboring peers</em>. The neighboring peers can change over time. The user will ask each of his neighboring peers for the list of chunks they have (one list per neighbor). The user starts downloading the chunks that have the fewest repeated copies among the neighbors (<strong>rares first</strong> technique). In this manner the rarest chunks get more quickly redistributed, roughly equalizing the numbers of copies of each chunk in the torrent.</p><p>Every 10 seconds the user measures the rate at which she receives bits and determines the four peers that are sending to her at the highest rate. It then reciprocates by sending chunks to these same four peers. The four peers are called <strong>unchocked</strong>. Every 30 seconds it also choses one additional neighbor and sends it chunks. These peers are called <strong>optmistically unchocked</strong>.</p><h3 id="262-distributed-hash-tables-dhts"><span class="me-2">2.6.2 Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs)</span><a href="#262-distributed-hash-tables-dhts" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>How to implement a simple database in a P2P network? In the P2P system each peer will only hold a small subset of the totality of the (key, value) pairs. Any peer can query the distributed database with a particular key, the database will locate the peers that have the corresponding pair and return the pair to querying peer. Any peer can also insert a new pair in the databse. Such a distributed database is referred to as a <strong>distributed hash table (DHT)</strong>. In a P2P file sharing application a DHT can be used to store the chunks associated to the IP of the peer in possession of them.</p><h6 id="an-approach">An approach:</h6><p>Let’s assign an identifier to each peer, where the identifier is an integer in the range <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[0, 2^n -1]</code></strong> for some fixed <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code></strong>. Such an identifier can be expressed by a <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n-bit</code></strong> representation. A hash function is used to transform non-integer values into integer values. We suppose that this function is available to all peers. <strong>How to assign keys to peers?</strong> We assign each <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">(key,value)</code> pair to the peer <strong><em>whose identifier is the closest to key</em></strong>, which is the identifier defined as <strong><em>the closest successor of the key</em></strong>. To avoid having each peer keeping track of all other peers (scalability issue) we use</p><h4 id="circular-dht"><span class="me-2">Circular DHT</span><a href="#circular-dht" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>If we organize peers into a circle, each peer only keeps track of its immediate successor and predecessor <strong>(modulo <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2^n</code>)</strong>. This circular arrangement of peers is a special case of an <strong>overlay network</strong>: the peers form an abstract logical network which resides above the “underlay” computer network, the overlay links are not physical but virtual liaisons between pairs of peers. A single overlay link typically uses many physical links and physical routers in the underlying network.</p><p>In the circle a peer asks “who is responsible for key <em>k</em>?” and it sends the message clockwise around the circle. Whenever a peer receives such message, it knows the identifier of its predecessor and predecessor, it can determine whether it is responsible (closest to) for the key in question. If not, it passes the message to its successor. When the message reaches the peer responsible for the key, it can send a message back to the querying peer indicating that it is responsible for that key. Using this system <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N/2*</code></strong> messages are sent on average <strong>(N = number of peers)</strong>. In designing a DHT there is always a tradeoff between the number of neighbors for each peer and the number of DHT messages needed to resolve a single query. (1 message if each peer keeps track of all other peers; <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N/2</code></strong> messages if each knows only 2 neighbors). To improve our circular DHT we could add shortcuts so that each peer not only keeps track of its immediate successor and predecessor but also of relatively small number of shortcut peers scattered around the circle. <strong>How many shortcut neighbors?</strong> Studies show that DHT can be designed so that the number of neighbors per peer as well as the number of messages per query is <strong><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">O(log *N*)</code> (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> the number of peers)</strong>.</p><h4 id="peer-churn"><span class="me-2">Peer Churn</span><a href="#peer-churn" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>In a P2P system, a peer can come or go without warning. To keep the DHT overlay in place in presence of a such peer churn we require each peer to keep track (know to IP address) of its predecessor and successor, and to periodically verify that its two successors are alive. If a peer abruptly leaves, its successor and predecessor need to update their information. The predecessor replaces its first successor with its second successor and ask it for the identifier and IP address of its immediate successor.</p><p>What if a peer joins? If it only knows one peer, it will ask him what will be his predecessor and successor. The message will reach the predecessor which will send the new arrived its predecessor and successor information. The new arrived can join the DHT making its predecessor successor its own successor and by notifying its predecessor to change its successor information.</p><h2 id="27-socket-programming-creating-network-applications"><span class="me-2">2.7 Socket Programming: Creating Network Applications</span><a href="#27-socket-programming-creating-network-applications" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Only code explication —-&gt; skipping</p><h1 id="chapter-3-transport-layer">Chapter 3: Transport Layer</h1><h2 id="31-introduction-and-transport-layer-services"><span class="me-2">3.1 Introduction and Transport-Layer Services</span><a href="#31-introduction-and-transport-layer-services" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>A transport-layer protocol provides for <strong>logical communication</strong> (as if the hosts running the processes were directly connected) between application processes running on different hosts.

This is done by breaking them into smaller chunks and adding a transport-layer header to each chunk. The transport-layer then passes the segment to the network-layer packet at the sending end-system. On the receiving side, the network layer extracts the transport-layer segment from the datagram and passes the segment up to the transport-layer which then processes the received segment, making the data in the segment available to the received application.</p><h3 id="311-relationship-between-transport-and-network-layers"><span class="me-2">3.1.1 Relationship Between Transport and Network Layers</span><a href="#311-relationship-between-transport-and-network-layers" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>A transport-layer protocol provides logical communication between <strong><em>processes</em></strong> running on different hosts.

TCP provides <strong>reliable data transfer</strong> using flow control, sequence numbers, acknowledgements and timers. <strong>TCP thus converts IP’s unreliable service between end systems into a reliable data transport service between processes</strong>. TCP also provides <strong>congestion control</strong>, a service not really provided to the invoking application as it is to the Internet as a whole: <strong>it prevents any TCP connection from swamping the links and routers between communication hosts with an excessive amount of traffic giving each connection traversing a congested link an equal share of the bandwidth.</strong></p><h2 id="32-multiplexing-and-demultiplexing"><span class="me-2">3.2 Multiplexing and Demultiplexing</span><a href="#32-multiplexing-and-demultiplexing" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Here we’ll cover multiplexing &amp; demultiplexing in the context of the Internet but <strong>a multiplexing/demultiplexing service is needed for all computer networks</strong>.</p><ul><li>The job of delivering the data in a transport-layer segment to the correct socket is called <strong>demultiplexing</strong>.<li>The job of gathering data chunks at the source host from different sockets, encapsulating each data chunk with header information (which will be used in demultiplexing) to create segments and passing the segments to the networks layer is called <strong>multiplexing</strong>.</ul><p>Therefore sockets need to have unique identifiers and each segment needs to have special fields that indicate the socket to which the segment is delivered.

If the developer chooses UDP, the application is almost directly talking with IP. Note that with UDP there is no handshaking between sending and receiving transport-layer entities before sending a segment. For this reason UDP is said to be <strong>connectionless</strong>. DNS is an example of an application layer protocol that typically uses UDP: there is no handshaking and when a client doesn’t receive a reply either it tries sending the query to another name server or it informs the invoking application that it can’t get a reply. Why should a developer choose UDP?</p><ul><li><em>Finer application-level controll over what data is sent and when</em>: as soon as the application passes data to UDP, UDP will package the data inside a segment and immediately pass it to the network layer. TCP’s congestion control can delay the sending of the segment and will try sending the packet until this is received. In real time applications the sending rate is important, so we can trade off some data loss for some sending rate.<li><em>No connection establishement</em> UDP justs send data without any formal preliminaries without introducing any delay, probably the reason why DNS runs over UDP.<li><em>No connection state</em>: because a UDP application doesn’t need to keep track of the users or to keep connections alive, it can typically support many more active clients than a TCP application<li><em>Small packet header overhead</em> TCP has 20 bytes of header overhead in every segment versus the 8 of UDP</ul><p>It is possible for an application developer to have reliable data transfer when using UDP.

TCP connection is not an end-to-end TDM or FDM circuit nor is it a virtual circuit as <strong>the connection state resides entirely in the two end systems</strong> and not in the intermediate network elements. A TCP connection provides a <strong>full-duplex service</strong>: when a connection between process A and process B, application layer data can flow from A to B and, at the same time, from B to A.

The first two cannot contain a payload while the third can. Three segments: <strong>three-way handshake</strong>. Both the sender and the receiver have buffers that are set up during the handshake. The maximum amount if data that can be grabbed and placed in a segment is limited by the <strong>maximum segment size (MSS)</strong>. TCP therefore splits data into smaller chunks and pairs each chunk of client data with a TCP header thereby forming <strong>TCP segments</strong> which are passed down to the network layer.

The TCP congestion-control mechanism operating at the sender keeps track of an additional variable: the <strong>congestion window</strong>, noted <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cwnd</code> which imposes a constraint on the rate at which a TCP sender can send traffic into the network. Specifically: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LastByteSent - LastByteAcked &lt;= min{cwnd, rwnd}</code>. Limiting the amount of unacknowledged data at the sender we can limit the sender’s send rate. At the beginning of each RTT the sender sends <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cwnd</code> bytes of data and at the end of the RTT he acknowledges. Thus <strong>the sender’s send rate is roughly <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cwnd/RTT</code> bytes/sec. Adjusting the value of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cwnd</code> the sender can adjust the rate at which it sends data into the connection</strong>. Let now consider a <em>loss event</em> (timeout OR three duplicate ACKs). When there is excessive congestion some router buffers along the path overflows, causing a loss event at the sender <em>which is taken by the sender to be an indication of congestion on the sender-to-receiver path</em>. If there is no congestion then all the acknowledgements will be received at the sender, which will take these arrivals as an indication that segments have been received and that he can increase the congestion window size and hence its transmission rate. If acknowledgements arrive at a slow rate then the congestion window will be increased at a relatively slow rate and, viceversa, it will be increased more quickly if ACKs arrive at a high rate. Because TCP uses acknowledgements to trigger (or clock) its increase in congestion window size, TCP is said to be <strong>self-clocking</strong>. TCP uses the principles:</p><ol><li><em>A lost segment implies congestion therefore the sender rate should be decreased.</em><li><em>An acknowledged segment means the network’s working, therefore the sender’s rate can be increased</em> (if ACK of unacknowledged segment)<li><em>Bandwidth probing</em>: the transmission rates increases with ACKs and decreases with loss events: TCP is continuously checking (probing) the congestion state of the network</ol><h3 id="tcp-congestion-control-algorithm"><span class="me-2">TCP Congestion-Control Algorithm</span><a href="#tcp-congestion-control-algorithm" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Three components :</p><h4 id="1---slow-start"><span class="me-2">1 - Slow Start</span><a href="#1---slow-start" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>When a TCP connection begins, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cwnd</code> is usually initialized to a small value of 1 MSS and only one segment is sent. <strong>Each acknowledged packet</strong> will cause the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cwnd</code> to be increased by 1 MSS and the sender will send now two segments (because the window is increased by one for each ack).

As each datagram is encapsulated in a link layer frame, the MTU imposes a hard limit on the length of the datagram. Each of the links along the route can use different link-layer protocols and therefore can have different MTU. We therefore have to break the IP datagram into smaller datagrams, each of which will go in different link layer frames. Each of these smaller datagrams is referred to as a <strong>fragment</strong>. A fragment must be reassembled before it can be passed to the transport layer. To reduce the workload on routers, the designers of IPv4 decided that reassembling should only be done at the destination end system.</p><p>In IPv4, to comply with fragmentation, the header contains the fields:</p><ul><li><em>Identifiers</em>: identifies the <strong>unfragmented datagram</strong> (same for all fragments)<li><em>flags</em>: in particular there is one flag set to 0 if the fragment is the last or to 1 if there are more to come<li><em>fragmentation offset</em>: an integer x, the data in the fragment should be inserted beginning at byte x * 8</ul><p>If one fragment contains error or is lost, all the others are dropped and TCP will have the sender retransmit all the data.

To determine whether anotehr node is IPv6 or IPv4-only DNS can be used, just checking whether the node has a IPv6 address or an IPv4 one. However this will bring about the loss of data in specific IPv6 header fields. Another approach would be <strong>tunneling</strong> : when two IPv6 nodes are connected by intervening IPv4 routers, we call the IPv4 nodes <strong>tunnel</strong>, the entire IPv6 datagram is put in the payload field of a IPv4 datagram which will be propagated by the tunnel unaware of the details and received by the destination IPv6 node which is able to extract the IPv6 datagram and to route it.

Whenever a host sends a packet, the packet is transferred to its default router, which we’ll call <strong>source router</strong>, we’ll call the default router for the destination host as the <strong>destination router</strong>. Routing a packet from source to destination boils down to routing the packet from source router to destination router.</p><p>The purpose of a routing algorithm is simple: given a set of routers connected by links, it finds a “good” path from source to destination router. <em>A good path is the least expensive one</em>.</p><p>Graphs (see Algorithms course) are used to formulate routing problems, the node representing routers and the edges the links connecting them. Each edge also has a <strong>value representing its cost</strong>. For any nodes x and y in the G(raph) we denote c(x,y) the cost of the edge between them. If (x,y) doesn’t belong to G, we set c(x,y) = infinity. We only consider undirected graphs. We just have to find the least costly paths between sources and destinations. We can classify routing algorithms in two groups:</p><ul><li><strong>Global routing algorithms</strong>: compute the least-cost path between a source and a destination using complete, global knowledge about the network. They are often referred to as <strong>link-state (LS) algorithms</strong> since the algorithm must be aware of the cost of each link in the network<li><strong>Decentralized routing algorthms</strong>: compute the least-cost path in an iterative, distributed manner: no node has complete information about the cost of all network links. Instead, each node begins with only the knowledge of the costs of its own directly attached links.</ul><p>We could also make another classification separating <strong>static routing algorithms</strong> (routes change very slowly, eg after human intervention) and <strong>dynamic routing algorithms</strong>( routing change as the load or topology change). Finally another distinction could be made between <strong>load-sensitive</strong> or <strong>load-insensitive</strong> algorithms according to whether link costs vary reflecting the level of congestion.</p><h3 id="451-the-link-state-ls-routing-algorithm"><span class="me-2">4.5.1 The Link-State (LS) Routing Algorithm</span><a href="#451-the-link-state-ls-routing-algorithm" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>All link costs are known.

The routing algorithm running <em>within</em> an AS is called an <strong>intra-autonomous system routing protocol</strong>. In an AS, one or more routers will have the task of being responsible for forwarding packets outside the AS, these routers are called <strong>gateway routers</strong>.

One often employed practice is to use <strong>hot-potato routing</strong>: the AS gets rid of the packet as quickly as possible (as inexpensively as possible), the router sends the packet to the gateway router that has the smallest router-to-gateway cost among all gateways with a path to the destination.

Each router maintains a RIP table known as a <strong>routing table</strong> which includes both the router’s distance vector and the router’s forwarding table.

Open indicates that the routing protocol speficication is publicly available. It was conceived as the successor to RIP. It is however a <strong>link state protocol</strong> that uses <strong>flooding of link-state information</strong> and a <strong>Dijkstra least-cost path algorithm</strong>: routers construct a complete topological map (graph) of the AS, then run Dijkstra’s algorithm to determine a shortest-path tree to <em>all subnets</em> with itself as the root node. Link costs are individually configured by the networks administrator who might choose to set all the link costs to 1, thus achieving minimum hop routuing or might choose to set the link weights to be <em>inversely proportional to link capacity</em> in order to discourage traffic from using low-bandwidth links. A router broadcasts routing information to <strong><em>all other routers</em></strong> in the AS, not just the neighbors. The broadcast happens whenever there is a change in a link’s state or every 30 minutes if the link’s state doesn’t change. OSPF advertisements are contained in <strong>OSPF messages</strong> that are carried by IP with an upper-lyerprotocol of 89 for OSPF, therefore OSPF must implement reliable message transfer and link-state broadcast; OSP also checks that links are operational using HELLO messages to attached neighbors. OSPF offers some services:</p><ul><li><em>security</em>: OSPF messages can be authenticated (not active by default).<li><em>multiple same-cost paths</em>: two paths having same cost can be used at the same time.<li><em>integrated support for unicast and multicast routing</em><li><em>support for hierarchy within a single routing domain</em>: ability to structure an autonomous system hierarchically.

To encode a bloc, the cipher uses a <em>on-to-one</em> mapping to map the <em>k</em>-bit block of cleartext to a <em>k</em>-bit block of ciphertext. To avoid bruteforce attacks, cipher blocks usually employ large blocks (<em>k</em>=64) but longer blocks implies longer tables to store the mappings. Block ciphers typically use functions that simulate randomly permuted tables. EX 64 bit input split into 8 8-bit chunks, each of which is processed by a 8-bit to 8-bit table, each chunk having its table. The encrypted chunks are reassembled into a 64 bits message which is fed again to the input. After <em>n</em> such cycles, the function provides a 64-bit block of ciphertext.

SSL is often used over HTTP, however, as it secures TCP, it can be employed by any application that runs over TCP. SSL provides a simple <em>Application Programming Interface</em> with sockets, similar to TCP’s API.

SSL breaks the data stream into <strong>records</strong>, appends a MAC to each record and then encrypts record+MAC. However, in a MITM attack, the order of packets could be reversed as TCP sequence numbers are not encrypted. SSL therefore uses sequence numbers. Bob keeps a sequence number counter which begins at zero and is incremented at each record transmission. He includesthe sequence number in the MAC calculation: MAC = hash(data+Mb+SeqNum).

Even with the use of error-detection bits, there still may be <strong>undetected bit errors</strong> (the receiver is unaware of the presence of corrupted bits). We want to keep the probability of such an event small. Let’s now consider three techniques for detecting errors in the transmitted data: parity checks, checksumming methods and cyclic redundancy checks</p><h3 id="521-parity-checks"><span class="me-2">5.2.1 Parity Checks</span><a href="#521-parity-checks" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Perhaps the simplest form of error detection is the use of a single <strong>parity bit</strong>. Suppose that the information to be sent, <em>D</em>, has <em>d</em> bits. In an even parity scheme, the sender simply includes one additional bit and chooses its value such that the total number of 1s in the <em>d+1</em> bits (original + parity bit) is even. (odd parity scheme, parity bit to one if #1s % 2 != 0). The receiver only needs to count the number of 1s in the <em>d+1</em> bits. If an odd number of 1 valued bits are found with an even parity scheme, the receiver knows that <em>some odd number</em> of bit error has occurred. If an even number of bit errors occur, this would result in an undetected error. Another approach is to use a <strong><em>two dimensional even parity</em></strong>: the <em>d</em> bits are divided into <em>i</em> rows and <em>j</em> columns. A parity value is computed for each row and for each column. The result <em>i + j + 1</em> parity bits comprise the error-detection bits. A single bit error in the original <em>d</em> bits will cause the parity of both the column and the row containing the flipped bit to to be in error. The receiver can not only detect the error, but also use the column and row indices of the column and row with parity errors to actually identify the bit that was corrupted and <em>correct</em> the error. This technique also allows to detect an error in the <em>parity bits</em>. The ability of the receiver to both detect and correct errors is known as <strong>forward error correction (FEC)</strong></p><h3 id="522-checksumming-methods"><span class="me-2">5.2.2 Checksumming Methods</span><a href="#522-checksumming-methods" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>The <em>d</em> bits of data are treated as a sequence of <em>k</em>-bit integers for example the Internet checksum already studied: bytes of data are treated as integers and summed, the 1s complement of this sum forms the Internet checksum carried in the header. The receiver checks the checksum by taking the 1s complement of the sum of the received data (including checksum) and checking whether the result is all 1 bits, if there are any 0, an error is indicated. In TCP and UDP the checksum is computed over all fields (header and data). Checksumming methods require little packet overhead but they provide relatively weak protection against errors. Why is checksumming used in transport layer and cyclic redundancy check used at the link layer? Transport layer is implemented in software (OS) and therefore needs a simple and fast error detection scheme while error detection at link layer is implemented in hardware which can perform the more complex CRC operations.</p><h3 id="523-cyclic-redundancy-check-crc"><span class="me-2">5.2.3 Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC)</span><a href="#523-cyclic-redundancy-check-crc" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) codes</strong> are also known as <strong>polynomial codes</strong> since it is possible to view the string to be sent as a polynomial whose coefficients are the 0 and 1 values in the bit string with operation interpreted as polynomial arithmetic. Sender and receiver must agree on a <em>r+1</em> bit pattern know as <strong>generator</strong> which we’ll denote as <em>G</em>. We require the leftmost bit of G to be a 1. For a given piece of data <em>D</em> the sender will choose <em>r</em> additional bits, <em>R</em>, and append them to <em>D</em> such that the resulting <em>d + r</em> bit pattern, interpreted as a binary number, is exactly divisible by G using modulo-2 arithmetic. Checking is therefore easy: the receiver divides the <em>d + r</em> received by bits by <em>G</em>, if the remainder is nonzero, an error has occurred, otherwise the data is accepted as being correct. All CRC calculations are done in modulo 2 without carries in addition or borrows in subtraction (+ = - = xor).</p><h2 id="53-multiple-access-links-and-protocols"><span class="me-2">5.3 Multiple Access Links and Protocols</span><a href="#53-multiple-access-links-and-protocols" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>There are two types of network links: point-to-point and broadcast links. A <strong>point-to-point link</strong> consists of a single sender at one end of the link and a single receiver at the other end of the link. A <strong>broadcast link</strong> can have multiple sending and receiving nodes all connected to the same, single, shared broadcast channel. The term <em>broadcast</em> is used because when any node transmits a frame, the channel broadcasts the frame and each other node receives a copy (ex: ethernet, wireless).</p><p>The <strong>multiple access problem</strong>: How to coordinate the access of multiple sending and receiving nodes to a shared broadcast channel? Computer networks have <strong>multiple access protocols</strong> by which nodes regulate their transmission into the shared broadcast channel. More than two nodes can transmit frames at the same time, which will result in all of the nodes receiving multiple frames at the same time: the frames <strong>collide</strong> at all of the receivers. Typically in case of collision, <em>none of the receiving nodes can make any sense of any of the frames</em>, they become inextricably tangled together and are therefore <strong>lost</strong>, the channel being wasted during collision. Thus it is necessary to coordinate the transmission of the active nodes. We can classify multiple access protocols in three categories: <strong>channel partitioning protocols, random access protocols, taking-turns protocols</strong>.</p><h3 id="531-channel-partitioning-protocols"><span class="me-2">5.3.1 Channel Partitioning Protocols</span><a href="#531-channel-partitioning-protocols" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>TDM and FDM (from circuit switching) are in this category. A third channel partitioning tool is <strong>code division multiple access (CDMA)</strong> which assigns a different <em>code</em> to each node. Each node then uses its unique code to encode the data bits it sends. If the codes are chosen carefully, then all nodes can transmit simultaneously and yet have their respective receivers correctly receive a sender’s encoded data bits. Originally used in military systems, it’s now widely used for civilian use, particularly in cellular telephony.</p><h3 id="532-random-access-protocols"><span class="me-2">5.3.2 Random Access Protocols</span><a href="#532-random-access-protocols" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>A transmitting node always transmits at the full rate of the channel, <em>R</em> bps. When there is a collision, each node involved in the collision repeatedly retransmits its frame until the frame gets through without a collision. But when a node experiences a collision, <em>it waits a random dely before retransmitting the frame</em>. The delay is chosen independently. Here a few of the most commonly used random access protocols:</p><h4 id="slotted-aloha"><span class="me-2">Slotted ALOHA</span><a href="#slotted-aloha" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>All frames consist of <em>L</em> bits, time is divided into slots of size <em>L/R</em> seconds, nodes start to transmit frames only at the beginning of slots. Moreover nodes are synchronized so that each node when the slot begins. If two or more frames collide in a slot, then all the nodes detect the collision event before the slot ends.</p><p>If <em>p</em> is a probability then the operation of slotted ALOHA in each node is simple:</p><ul><li>each node waits the beginning of the next slot to transmit the entire frame in a slot<li>If no collision occurs, the frame is considered delivered<li>If collision, this is detect before the end of the slot. The node retransmits its frame <em>in each subsequent slot</em> with probability <em>p</em> (probability of retransmission) until the frame is transmitted without a collision.</ul><p>Slotted ALOHA allows transmission at full rate <em>R</em>, is highly decentralized, and is extremely simple.

The node immediately transmits a frame in its entirety in the channel. In case of collision, the node will then immediately retransmit the frame with probability <em>p</em> otherwise the node waits for a frame transmission time, after which it transmits the frame with probability <em>p</em> or wait for another frame with probability <em>1-p</em>. The maximum efficiency is 1/(2e) but the protocol is fully decentralized.</p><h4 id="carrier-sense-multiple-access-csma"><span class="me-2">Carrier Sense Multiple Access (CSMA)</span><a href="#carrier-sense-multiple-access-csma" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>CSMA and CSMA/CD (collision detection) embody two rules:</p><ul><li><strong>carrier sensing</strong>: if a node is transmitting, the others wait until they detect no transmission for a short amount of time and begin transmission.<li><strong>collision detection</strong>: a transmitting node listens to the channel while it’s transmitting, if it detects that another node is transmitting, it stops transmitting and waits for a random amount of time before repeating the sense-and-transmit-when-idle-cycle.</ul><p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamirPaulb/assets/main/blog-csmaDIA.png" class="popup img-link shimmer"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamirPaulb/assets/main/blog-csmaDIA.png" alt="csmaDIA" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>It is evident that the <strong>propagation delay</strong> of the channel plays a crucial role: the longer, the larger the chance that a carrier sensing node is not yet able to sense a transmission that has already begun.</p><h4 id="carrier-sense-multiple-access-with-collision-detection-csmacd"><span class="me-2">Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD)</span><a href="#carrier-sense-multiple-access-with-collision-detection-csmacd" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>When a node detects a collision, it ceases transmission immediately in Collision Detection. A link layer frame is prepared, if the node senses that the channel is idle (no energy is entering the adapter from the channel), it starts to transmit the frame, else it waits until it detects idle. While transmitting, the node monitors the channel for usage from other nodes, if the entire frame is transmitted without detecting usage, then the adapter is finished. If energy is detected from other adapters while transmitting, the node aborts transmission (stops), waits for a random amount of time and then returns to checking for idle.</p><p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamirPaulb/assets/main/blog-csmacdDIA.png" class="popup img-link shimmer"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamirPaulb/assets/main/blog-csmacdDIA.png" alt="csmacdDIA" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>The wait for random amount of time is required in order to avoid the nodes to keep colliding.</p><h4 id="csmacd-efficiency"><span class="me-2">CSMA/CD Efficiency</span><a href="#csmacd-efficiency" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>Is the long run fraction of time during which frames are being transmitted without collision.

It requires one of the nodes to be designated as a master node which <strong>polls</strong> each of the nodes in a round-robin fashion. The master tells node 1 that it can transmit up to some maximum number of frames, when node 1 is finished (the master checks for energy in the channel) the master tells the same to node 2 and so on. The polling protocol eliminates the collisions and empty slots that plague random access protocols, resulting in a much higher efficiency. However it introduces a <em>polling delay</em> (the amount of time required to notify a node that it can transmit) [if only one is transmitting, it will have to wait for the master to poll all the others]. Moreover the master node represents a single point of failure.</p><p>The second protocol is the <strong>token-passing protocol</strong> in which there is no master method. A small, special purpose frame known as <strong>token</strong> is exchanged among the nodes in some fixed order. When a node receives a toke, it holds it only if it has some frames to transmit otherwise it immediately forwards it to the next node.If a node has frames to transmit when it receives the token, it sends up to a maximum number of frames and then passes the token. Token passing is decentralized and highly efficient but the failure of one node could crash the entire channel, or a node could neglect to release the token….</p><h3 id="534-docsis-the-link-layer-protocol-for-cable-internet-access"><span class="me-2">5.3.4 DOCSIS: The Link-Layer Protocol for Cable Internet Access</span><a href="#534-docsis-the-link-layer-protocol-for-cable-internet-access" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>The Data-Over-Cable-Service-Interface-Specifications specifies the cable data network architecture and its protocols. DOCSIS uses FDM to divide the downstream and upstream network segments into multiple frequency channels. Each upstream and downstream channel is a broadcast channel. Several cable modems share the same upstream channel (frequency) to the CMTS and thus collision can potentially occur. Each upstream channel is divided into intervals of time (TDM-like) each containing a sequence of mini-slots during which cable modems can transmit to the CMTS, which explicitly grants permission to individual modems to transmit during specific mini-slots. This is done sending a special control message known as a MAP message on a downstream channel to specify which cable modem can transmit during which mini-slot. Modems send mini-slot-request frames to the CMTS during a special set of interval mini-slots dedicated for this purpose. The requests are transmitted in a random access manner and may collide with each other. The modem cannot detect activity nor collisions: it simply infers that its request experienced collision if it does not receive a response in the next downstream control message. When a collision is inferred, a modem uses binary exponential backoff to defer the transmission to a future slot.</p><h2 id="54-switched-local-area-networks"><span class="me-2">5.4 Switched Local Area Networks</span><a href="#54-switched-local-area-networks" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Switched local networks connect hosts using link-layer switches which <strong>do not run networks-layer protocols</strong>.</p><h3 id="541-link-layer-addressing-and-arp"><span class="me-2">5.4.1 Link-Layer Addressing and ARP</span><a href="#541-link-layer-addressing-and-arp" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><h4 id="mac-addresses"><span class="me-2">MAC Addresses</span><a href="#mac-addresses" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>Network interfaces in hosts and routers have link-layer addresses, however <em>link-layer switches do not have link-layer addresses associated with their interfaces</em> so that they can carry datagrams without having routers or hosts having to explicitly address the frame to the intervening switch. A link-layer address is called <strong>LAN address</strong>, <strong>physical address</strong> or <strong>MAC address</strong>, the last name being the most popular. This address is <strong>6 bytes long</strong>, typically expressed in hexadecimal notation. They are supposed to be permanent but can be changed via software. <strong>No two adapters have the same address</strong>: the IEEE manages the MAC address space, usually assigning a 24 prefix to each manufacturer and letting him choose the content of the remaining 24 bits. MAC address have a flat structure (no hierarchy such as in IP) and do not change. When an adapter wants to send a frame to some destination adapter, it inserts the destination adapter’s MAC address into the frame and then sends the frame into the LAN. An adapter might receive a frame that isn’t addressed to it, when this happens, the adapter checks whether the frame’s destination address matches its own, if not it discards the frame. When a sending adapter want to broadcast to the whole network, it inserts a special <strong>MAC broadcast address</strong> into the destination address field, for 6bytes addresses that is FF-FF-FF-FF-FF-FF</p><h4 id="address-resolution-protocol-arp"><span class="me-2">Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)</span><a href="#address-resolution-protocol-arp" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p>The <strong>Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)</strong> translates network-layer addresses into link-layer addresses, analogously to DNS, but ARP resolves IP addresses only for hosts and router interfaces on the same subnet. Each host and router has an <strong>ARP table</strong> which contain mappings of IP addresses to MAC addresses and a time-to-live TTL value which indicates when each mapping will be deleted from the table. A typical TTL is 20 minutes from when an entry is placed in the ARP table. The table does not necessarily contain an entry for every host and router on the subnet. What if a frame has to be sent to an address which does not appear in the table? The sender creates a special packet, an <strong>ARP packet</strong>, containing the sending and receiving IP and MAC addresses. Both ARP query and response have the same format: the sending forwards the ARP request to the broadcast address (destination address) the frame containing the query is received by all the other adapters in the subnet. Each adapter passes the frame to the ARP module which checks if its IP address matches the destination IP address in the query. The one with a match sends back the response with the desired mapping. The querying can update its table and send the IP datagram encapsulated in a link-layer frame. ARP is plug and play: the table gets build automatically. ARP stands in the boundary between the link and network layers.</p><h3 id="sending-a-datagram-off-the-subnet"><span class="me-2">Sending a Datagram off the Subnet</span><a href="#sending-a-datagram-off-the-subnet" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>A datagram that has to be sent out of the subnet is first sent to the first-hop router on the path to the final destination (which is outside the subnet).

This is done using the forwarding table: the router extracts the datagram and checks the destination IP. The datagram is encapsulated again and sent into the subnet, this time the MAC address of the frame is indeed the destination MAC address of the ultimate destination, which the router acquire via ARP.</p><h3 id="542-ethernet"><span class="me-2">5.4.2 Ethernet</span><a href="#542-ethernet" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>It has pretty much taken over the wired LAN market.

A <strong>hub</strong> is a physical layer device that acts on individual bits rather than frames. When a hub receives a bit, it simply recreates it boosting its energy strength and transmits the bit onto all the other interfaces (it’s still a broadcast LAN). In the early 2000s, the star topology evolved: the hub was replaced with a <strong>switch</strong>, allowing a collision-less LAN.</p><h4 id="ethernet-frame-structure"><span class="me-2">Ethernet Frame Structure</span><a href="#ethernet-frame-structure" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h4><p><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamirPaulb/assets/main/blog-ethernetframe.png" class="popup img-link shimmer"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SamirPaulb/assets/main/blog-ethernetframe.png" alt="ethernet frame" loading="lazy"></a></p><ul><li><em>Data fields</em> (46 to 1,500 bytes): carries the IP datagram (or other network-layer datagram).

Switches are plug-and-play, have relatively high filtering and forwarding rates. However to <strong>prevent the cycling of broadcast frames, the active topology of a swtiched network is restricted to a spanning tree</strong>. A large network requires large ARP tables in hosts and routers and would generate substantial ARP traffic and processing. Switches are also susceptible to broadcast storms: if one goes crazy and send an endless stream of broadcast frames, the others will forward all of the frames resulting in a network collapse. Routers network addressing is hierarchical, packets do not normally cycle and the topology is not limited to a spanning tree even when the network has redundant paths. Therefore packets can use the best path between source and destination. But routers are not plug-and-play (a host need the IP to connect) and often have a larger per-packet processing time than switches.
