is system design?</h1><p>Before we start this course, let’s talk about what even is system design.</p><p>System design is the process of defining the architecture, interfaces, and data for a system that satisfies specific requirements. System design meets the needs of your business or organization through coherent and efficient systems. It requires a systematic approach to building and engineering systems. A good system design requires us to think about everything, from infrastructure all the way down to the data and how it’s stored.</p><h2 id="why-is-system-design-so-important"><span class="me-2">Why is System Design so important?</span><a href="#why-is-system-design-so-important" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>System design helps us define a solution that meets the business requirements. It is one of the earliest decisions we can make when building a system. Often it is essential to think from a high level as these decisions are very difficult to correct later. It also makes it easier to reason about and manage architectural changes as the system evolves.</p><h1 id="ip">IP</h1><p>An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the internet or a local network. IP stands for <em>“Internet Protocol”</em>, which is the set of rules governing the format of data sent via the internet or local network.</p><p>In essence, IP addresses are the identifier that allows information to be sent between devices on a network. They contain location information and make devices accessible for communication. The internet needs a way to differentiate between different computers, routers, and websites. IP addresses provide a way of doing so and form an essential part of how the internet works.</p><h2 id="versions"><span class="me-2">Versions</span><a href="#versions" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Now, let’s learn about the different versions of IP addresses:</p><h3 id="ipv4"><span class="me-2">IPv4</span><a href="#ipv4" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>The original Internet Protocol is IPv4 which uses a 32-bit numeric dot-decimal notation that only allows for around 4 billion IP addresses. Initially, it was more than enough but as internet adoption grew we needed something better.</p><p><em>Example: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">102.22.192.181</code></em></p><h3 id="ipv6"><span class="me-2">IPv6</span><a href="#ipv6" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>IPv6 is a new protocol that was introduced in 1998. Deployment commenced in the mid-2000s and since the internet users have grown exponentially, it is still ongoing.</p><p>This new protocol uses 128-bit alphanumeric hexadecimal notation. This means that IPv6 can provide about ~340e+36 IP addresses. That’s more than enough to meet the growing demand for years to come.</p><p><em>Example: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334</code></em></p><h2 id="types"><span class="me-2">Types</span><a href="#types" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Let’s discuss types of IP addresses:</p><h3 id="public"><span class="me-2">Public</span><a href="#public" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>A public IP address is an address where one primary address is associated with your whole network. In this type of IP address, each of the connected devices has the same IP address.</p><p><em>Example: IP address provided to your router by the ISP.</em></p><h3 id="private"><span class="me-2">Private</span><a href="#private" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>A private IP address is a unique IP number assigned to every device that connects to your internet network, which includes devices like computers, tablets, and smartphones, which are used in your household.</p><p><em>Example: IP addresses generated by your home router for your devices.</em></p><h3 id="static"><span class="me-2">Static</span><a href="#static" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>A static IP address does not change and is one that was manually created, as opposed to having been assigned. These addresses are usually more expensive but are more reliable.</p><p><em>Example: They are usually used for important things like reliable geo-location services, remote access, server hosting, etc.</em></p><h3 id="dynamic"><span class="me-2">Dynamic</span><a href="#dynamic" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>A dynamic IP address changes from time to time and is not always the same. It has been assigned by a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol">Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP)</a> server. Dynamic IP addresses are the most common type of internet protocol addresses. They are cheaper to deploy and allow us to reuse IP addresses within a network as needed.</p><p><em>Example: They are more commonly used for consumer equipment and personal use.</em></p><h1 id="osi-model">OSI Model</h1><p>The OSI Model is a logical and conceptual model that defines network communication used by systems open to interconnection and communication with other systems. The Open System Interconnection (OSI Model) also defines a logical network and effectively describes computer packet transfer by using various layers of protocols.</p><p>The OSI Model can be seen as a universal language for computer networking. It’s based on the concept of splitting up a communication system into seven abstract layers, each one stacked upon the last.</p><p><a href="/assets/img/system-design/osi-model.jpg" class="popup img-link shimmer"><img src="/assets/img/system-design/osi-model.jpg" alt="osi-model" loading="lazy"></a></p><h2 id="why-does-the-osi-model-matter"><span class="me-2">Why does the OSI model matter?</span><a href="#why-does-the-osi-model-matter" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>The Open System Interconnection (OSI) model has defined the common terminology used in networking discussions and documentation. This allows us to take a very complex communications process apart and evaluate its components.</p><p>While this model is not directly implemented in the TCP/IP networks that are most common today, it can still help us do so much more, such as:</p><ul><li>Make troubleshooting easier and help identify threats across the entire stack.<li>Encourage hardware manufacturers to create networking products that can communicate with each other over the network.<li>Essential for developing a security-first mindset.<li>Separate a complex function into simpler components.</ul><h2 id="layers"><span class="me-2">Layers</span><a href="#layers" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>The seven abstraction layers of the OSI model can be defined as follows, from top to bottom:</p><h3 id="application"><span class="me-2">Application</span><a href="#application" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>This is the only layer that directly interacts with data from the user. Software applications like web browsers and email clients rely on the application layer to initiate communication. But it should be made clear that client software applications are not part of the application layer, rather the application layer is responsible for the protocols and data manipulation that the software relies on to present meaningful data to the user. Application layer protocols include HTTP as well as SMTP.</p><h3 id="presentation"><span class="me-2">Presentation</span><a href="#presentation" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>The presentation layer is also called the Translation layer. The data from the application layer is extracted here and manipulated as per the required format to transmit over the network. The functions of the presentation layer are translation, encryption/decryption, and compression.</p><h3 id="session"><span class="me-2">Session</span><a href="#session" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>This is the layer responsible for opening and closing communication between the two devices. The time between when the communication is opened and closed is known as the session. The session layer ensures that the session stays open long enough to transfer all the data being exchanged, and then promptly closes the session in order to avoid wasting resources. The session layer also synchronizes data transfer with checkpoints.</p><h3 id="transport"><span class="me-2">Transport</span><a href="#transport" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>The transport layer (also known as layer 4) is responsible for end-to-end communication between the two devices. This includes taking data from the session layer and breaking it up into chunks called segments before sending it to the Network layer (layer 3). It is also responsible for reassembling the segments on the receiving device into data the session layer can consume.</p><h3 id="network"><span class="me-2">Network</span><a href="#network" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>The network layer is responsible for facilitating data transfer between two different networks. The network layer breaks up segments from the transport layer into smaller units, called packets, on the sender’s device, and reassembles these packets on the receiving device. The network layer also finds the best physical path for the data to reach its destination this is known as routing. <strong>If the two devices communicating are on the same network, then the network layer is unnecessary.</strong></p><h3 id="data-link"><span class="me-2">Data Link</span><a href="#data-link" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>The data link layer is very similar to the network layer, except the <strong>data link layer facilitates data transfer between two devices on the same network.</strong> The data link layer takes packets from the network layer and breaks them into smaller pieces called frames.</p><h3 id="physical"><span class="me-2">Physical</span><a href="#physical" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>This layer includes the physical equipment involved in the data transfer, such as the cables and switches. This is also the layer where the data gets converted into a bit stream, which is a string of 1s and 0s. The physical layer of both devices must also agree on a signal convention so that the 1s can be distinguished from the 0s on both devices.</p><h1 id="tcp-and-udp">TCP and UDP</h1><h2 id="tcp"><span class="me-2">TCP</span><a href="#tcp" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is connection-oriented, meaning once a connection has been established, data can be transmitted in both directions. TCP has built-in systems to check for errors and to guarantee data will be delivered in the order it was sent, making it the perfect protocol for transferring information like still images, data files, and web pages.</p><p><a href="/assets/img/system-design/tcp.jpg" class="popup img-link shimmer"><img src="/assets/img/system-design/tcp.jpg" alt="tcp" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>But while TCP is instinctively reliable, its feedback mechanisms also result in a larger overhead, translating to greater use of the available bandwidth on the network.</p><h2 id="udp"><span class="me-2">UDP</span><a href="#udp" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a simpler, connectionless internet protocol in which error-checking and recovery services are not required. With UDP, there is no overhead for opening a connection, maintaining a connection, or terminating a connection. Data is continuously sent to the recipient, whether or not they receive it.</p><p><a href="/assets/img/system-design/udp.jpg" class="popup img-link shimmer"><img src="/assets/img/system-design/udp.jpg" alt="udp" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>It is largely preferred for real-time communications like broadcast or multicast network transmission. We should use UDP over TCP when we need the lowest latency and late data is worse than the loss of data.</p><h2 id="tcp-vs-udp"><span class="me-2">TCP vs UDP</span><a href="#tcp-vs-udp" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>TCP is a connection-oriented protocol, whereas UDP is a connectionless protocol. A key difference between TCP and UDP is speed, as TCP is comparatively slower than UDP.

The recursive resolver acts as a middleman between a client and a DNS nameserver. After receiving a DNS query from a web client, a recursive resolver will either respond with cached data, or send a request to a root nameserver, followed by another request to a TLD nameserver, and then one last request to an authoritative nameserver. After receiving a response from the authoritative nameserver containing the requested IP address, the recursive resolver then sends a response to the client.</p><h3 id="dns-root-server"><span class="me-2">DNS root server</span><a href="#dns-root-server" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>A root server accepts a recursive resolver’s query which includes a domain name, and the root nameserver responds by directing the recursive resolver to a TLD nameserver, based on the extension of that domain (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.com</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.net</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.org</code>, etc.).

The authoritative nameserver contains information specific to the domain name it serves (e.g. <a href="http://google.com">google.com</a>) and it can provide a recursive resolver with the IP address of that server found in the DNS A record, or if the domain has a CNAME record (alias) it will provide the recursive resolver with an alias domain, at which point the recursive resolver will have to perform a whole new DNS lookup to procure a record from an authoritative nameserver (often an A record containing an IP address).

If the DNS resolver has the relevant DNS records in its cache, it returns them.

The DNS client must then repeat the query directly against the DNS server it was referred.</p><h3 id="non-recursive"><span class="me-2">Non-recursive</span><a href="#non-recursive" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>A non-recursive query is a query in which the DNS Resolver already knows the answer. It either immediately returns a DNS record because it already stores it in a local cache, or queries a DNS Name Server which is authoritative for the record, meaning it definitely holds the correct IP for that hostname. In both cases, there is no need for additional rounds of queries (like in recursive or iterative queries). Rather, a response is immediately returned to the client.</p><h2 id="records-types"><span class="me-2">Records Types</span><a href="#records-types" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>DNS records (aka zone files) are instructions that live in authoritative DNS servers and provide information about a domain including what IP address is associated with that domain and how to handle requests for that domain.</p><p>These records consist of a series of text files written in what is known as <em>DNS syntax</em>. DNS syntax is just a string of characters used as commands that tell the DNS server what to do. All DNS records also have a <em>“TTL”</em>, which stands for time-to-live, and indicates how often a DNS server will refresh that record.</p><p>There are more record types but for now, let’s look at some of the most commonly used ones:</p><ul><li><strong>A (Address record)</strong>: This is the record that holds the IP address of a domain.<li><strong>AAAA (IP Version 6 Address record)</strong>: The record that contains the IPv6 address for a domain (as opposed to A records, which stores the IPv4 address).<li><strong>CNAME (Canonical Name record)</strong>: Forwards one domain or subdomain to another domain, does NOT provide an IP address.<li><strong>MX (Mail exchanger record)</strong>: Directs mail to an email server.<li><strong>TXT (Text Record)</strong>: This record lets an admin store text notes in the record. These records are often used for email security.<li><strong>NS (Name Server records)</strong>: Stores the name server for a DNS entry.<li><strong>SOA (Start of Authority)</strong>: Stores admin information about a domain.<li><strong>SRV (Service Location record)</strong>: Specifies a port for specific services.<li><strong>PTR (Reverse-lookup Pointer records)</strong>: Provides a domain name in reverse lookups.<li><strong>CERT (Certificate record)</strong>: Stores public key certificates.</ul><h2 id="subdomains"><span class="me-2">Subdomains</span><a href="#subdomains" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>A subdomain is an additional part of our main domain name. It is commonly used to logically separate a website into sections. We can create multiple subdomains or child domains on the main domain.</p><p>For example, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blog.example.com</code> where <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blog</code> is the subdomain, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">example</code> is the primary domain and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.com</code> is the top-level domain (TLD).

A DNS zone is also an administrative function, allowing for granular control of DNS components, such as authoritative name servers.</p><h2 id="dns-caching"><span class="me-2">DNS Caching</span><a href="#dns-caching" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>A DNS cache (sometimes called a DNS resolver cache) is a temporary database, maintained by a computer’s operating system, that contains records of all the recent visits and attempted visits to websites and other internet domains. In other words, a DNS cache is just a memory of recent DNS lookups that our computer can quickly refer to when it’s trying to figure out how to load a website.</p><p>The Domain Name System implements a time-to-live (TTL) on every DNS record. TTL specifies the number of seconds the record can be cached by a DNS client or server. When the record is stored in a cache, whatever TTL value came with it gets stored as well. The server continues to update the TTL of the record stored in the cache, counting down every second. When it hits zero, the record is deleted or purged from the cache. At that point, if a query for that record is received, the DNS server has to start the resolution process.</p><h2 id="reverse-dns"><span class="me-2">Reverse DNS</span><a href="#reverse-dns" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>A reverse DNS lookup is a DNS query for the domain name associated with a given IP address. This accomplishes the opposite of the more commonly used forward DNS lookup, in which the DNS system is queried to return an IP address. The process of reverse resolving an IP address uses PTR records. If the server does not have a PTR record, it cannot resolve a reverse lookup.</p><p>Reverse lookups are commonly used by email servers. Email servers check and see if an email message came from a valid server before bringing it onto their network. Many email servers will reject messages from any server that does not support reverse lookups or from a server that is highly unlikely to be legitimate.</p><p><em>Note: Reverse DNS lookups are not universally adopted as they are not critical to the normal function of the internet.</em></p><h2 id="examples"><span class="me-2">Examples</span><a href="#examples" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>These are some widely used managed DNS solutions:</p><ul><li><a href="https://aws.amazon.com/route53">Route53</a><li><a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/dns">Cloudflare DNS</a><li><a href="https://cloud.google.com/dns">Google Cloud DNS</a><li><a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/dns">Azure DNS</a><li><a href="https://ns1.com/products/managed-dns">NS1</a></ul><h1 id="load-balancing">Load Balancing</h1><p>Load balancing lets us distribute incoming network traffic across multiple resources ensuring high availability and reliability by sending requests only to resources that are online.

This ensures that no single server is overworked, which could degrade performance. If a single server goes down, the load balancer redirects traffic to the remaining online servers.

The software approach gives us the flexibility of configuring the load balancer to our environment’s specific needs. The boost in flexibility may come at the cost of having to do more work to set up the load balancer. Compared to hardware versions, which offer more of a closed-box approach, software balancers give us more freedom to make changes and upgrades.</p><p>Software load balancers are widely used and are available either as installable solutions that require configuration and management or as a managed cloud service.</p><h3 id="hardware"><span class="me-2">Hardware</span><a href="#hardware" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>As the name implies, a hardware load balancer relies on physical, on-premises hardware to distribute application and network traffic.

Each edge location contains a number of caching servers responsible for content delivery to visitors within its proximity.</p><p>Once the static assets are cached on all the CDN servers for a particular location, all subsequent website visitor requests for static assets will be delivered from these edge servers instead of the origin, thus reducing origin load and improving scalability.</p><p>For example, when someone in the UK requests our website which might be hosted in the USA, they will be served from the closest edge location such as the London edge location.

Content is uploaded only when it is new or changed, minimizing traffic, but maximizing storage.</p><p>Sites with a small amount of traffic or sites with content that isn’t often updated work well with push CDNs.

A simplified way to sum it up would be to say that a forward proxy sits in front of a client and ensures that no origin server ever communicates directly with that specific client.

These items are organized as a set of tables with columns and rows. Tables are used to hold information about the objects to be represented in the database. Each column in a table holds a certain kind of data and a field stores the actual value of an attribute. The rows in the table represent a collection of related values of one object or entity.</p><p>Each row in a table could be marked with a unique identifier called a primary key, and rows among multiple tables can be made related using foreign keys. This data can be accessed in many different ways without re-organizing the database tables themselves.

Although the replication process may occur in near-real-time, it is more common for replication to occur on a scheduled basis and it is more cost-effective.</p><h1 id="indexes">Indexes</h1><p>Indexes are well known when it comes to databases, they are used to improve the speed of data retrieval operations on the data store. An index makes the trade-offs of increased storage overhead, and slower writes (since we not only have to write the data but also have to update the index) for the benefit of faster reads. Indexes are used to quickly locate data without having to examine every row in a database table. Indexes can be created using one or more columns of a database table, providing the basis for both rapid random lookups and efficient access to ordered records.</p><p><a href="/assets/img/system-design/indexes.jpg" class="popup img-link shimmer"><img src="/assets/img/system-design/indexes.jpg" alt="indexes" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>An index is a data structure that can be perceived as a table of contents that points us to the location where actual data lives. So when we create an index on a column of a table, we store that column and a pointer to the whole row in the index. Indexes are also used to create different views of the same data. For large data sets, this is an excellent way to specify different filters or sorting schemes without resorting to creating multiple additional copies of the data.</p><p>One quality that database indexes can have is that they can be <strong>dense</strong> or <strong>sparse</strong>. Each of these index qualities comes with its own trade-offs. Let’s look at how each index type would work:</p><h2 id="dense-index"><span class="me-2">Dense Index</span><a href="#dense-index" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>In a dense index, an index record is created for every row of the table. Records can be located directly as each record of the index holds the search key value and the pointer to the actual record.</p><p><a href="/assets/img/system-design/dense-index.jpg" class="popup img-link shimmer"><img src="/assets/img/system-design/dense-index.jpg" alt="dense-index" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>Dense indexes require more maintenance than sparse indexes at write-time. Since every row must have an entry, the database must maintain the index on inserts, updates, and deletes. Having an entry for every row also means that dense indexes will require more memory. The benefit of a dense index is that values can be quickly found with just a binary search. Dense indexes also do not impose any ordering requirements on the data.</p><h2 id="sparse-index"><span class="me-2">Sparse Index</span><a href="#sparse-index" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>In a sparse index, records are created only for some of the records.</p><p><a href="/assets/img/system-design/sparse-index.jpg" class="popup img-link shimmer"><img src="/assets/img/system-design/sparse-index.jpg" alt="sparse-index" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>Sparse indexes require less maintenance than dense indexes at write-time since they only contain a subset of the values. This lighter maintenance burden means that inserts, updates, and deletes will be faster. Having fewer entries also means that the index will use less memory. Finding data is slower since a scan across the page typically follows the binary search. Sparse indexes are also optional when working with ordered data.</p><h1 id="normalization-and-denormalization">Normalization and Denormalization</h1><h2 id="terms"><span class="me-2">Terms</span><a href="#terms" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Before we go any further, let’s look at some commonly used terms in normalization and denormalization.</p><h3 id="keys"><span class="me-2">Keys</span><a href="#keys" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Primary key</strong>: Column or group of columns that can be used to uniquely identify every row of the table.</p><p><strong>Composite key</strong>: A primary key made up of multiple columns.</p><p><strong>Super key</strong>: Set of all keys that can uniquely identify all the rows present in a table.</p><p><strong>Candidate key</strong>: Attributes that identify rows uniquely in a table.</p><p><strong>Foreign key</strong>: It is a reference to a primary key of another table.</p><p><strong>Alternate key</strong>: Keys that are not primary keys are known as alternate keys.</p><p><strong>Surrogate key</strong>: A system-generated value that uniquely identifies each entry in a table when no other column was able to hold properties of a primary key.</p><h3 id="dependencies"><span class="me-2">Dependencies</span><a href="#dependencies" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p><strong>Partial dependency</strong>: Occurs when the primary key determines some other attributes.</p><p><strong>Functional dependency</strong>: It is a relationship that exists between two attributes, typically between the primary key and non-key attribute within a table.</p><p><strong>Transitive functional dependency</strong>: Occurs when some non-key attribute determines some other attribute.</p><h3 id="anomalies"><span class="me-2">Anomalies</span><a href="#anomalies" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Database anomaly happens when there is a flaw in the database due to incorrect planning or storing everything in a flat database.

Most 3NF relations are free of insertion, update, and deletion anomalies.</p><p>As with many formal rules and specifications, real-world scenarios do not always allow for perfect compliance. If you decide to violate one of the first three rules of normalization, make sure that your application anticipates any problems that could occur, such as redundant data and inconsistent dependencies.</p><h3 id="advantages-8"><span class="me-2">Advantages</span><a href="#advantages-8" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Here are some advantages of normalization:</p><ul><li>Reduces data redundancy.<li>Better data design.<li>Increases data consistency.<li>Enforces referential integrity.</ul><h3 id="disadvantages-6"><span class="me-2">Disadvantages</span><a href="#disadvantages-6" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Let’s look at some disadvantages of normalization:</p><ul><li>Data design is complex.<li>Slower performance.<li>Maintenance overhead.<li>Require more joins.</ul><h2 id="denormalization"><span class="me-2">Denormalization</span><a href="#denormalization" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Denormalization is a database optimization technique in which we add redundant data to one or more tables.

To increase the ability to scale and at the same time be highly available, we move the logic from the database to separate servers. In this way, the database becomes more independent and focused on the actual process of storing data.</p><p>In the NoSQL database world, ACID transactions are less common as some databases have loosened the requirements for immediate consistency, data freshness, and accuracy in order to gain other benefits, like scale and resilience.</p><p>BASE properties are much looser than ACID guarantees, but there isn’t a direct one-for-one mapping between the two consistency models. Let us understand these terms:</p><h3 id="basic-availability"><span class="me-2">Basic Availability</span><a href="#basic-availability" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>The database appears to work most of the time.</p><h3 id="soft-state"><span class="me-2">Soft-state</span><a href="#soft-state" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Stores don’t have to be write-consistent, nor do different replicas have to be mutually consistent all the time.</p><h3 id="eventual-consistency"><span class="me-2">Eventual consistency</span><a href="#eventual-consistency" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>The data might not be consistent immediately but eventually, it becomes consistent.

It’s essential to be familiar with the BASE behavior of the chosen database and work within those constraints.</p><p>On the other hand, planning around BASE limitations can sometimes be a major disadvantage when compared to the simplicity of ACID transactions.

If we perform a read operation on a consistent system, it should return the value of the most recent write operation. The read should cause all nodes to return the same data. All users see the same data at the same time, regardless of the node they connect to. When data is written to a single node, it is then replicated across the other nodes in the system. For this to happen, whenever data is written to one node, it must be instantly forwarded or replicated across all the nodes in the system before the write is deemed “successful”.</p><p>Financial data is a good example. When a user logs in to their banking institution, they do not want to see an error that no data is returned, or that the value is higher or lower than it actually is. Banking apps should return the exact value of a user’s account information. In this case, banks would rely on consistent databases.</p><p>Examples of a consistent database include:</p><ul><li>Bank account balances<li>Text messages</ul><p>Database options for consistency:</p><ul><li>MongoDB<li>Redis<li>HBase</ul><h3 id="availability-1"><span class="me-2">Availability</span><a href="#availability-1" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>When availability is present in a distributed system, it means that the <strong>system remains operational all of the time</strong>. Every request will get a response regardless of the individual state of the nodes. This means that the system will operate even if there are multiple nodes down. Unlike a consistent system, there’s <strong>no guarantee that the response will be the most recent write operation</strong>.</p><p>Example of a highly available database:</p><ul><li>On <strong>YouTube</strong> and <strong>social media</strong> like Facebook and Instagram, we can ignore consistency in views or likes count but the <strong>availability of videos and posts is essential</strong>.<li>In <strong>e-commerce businesses</strong>.

A CA database delivers consistency and availability across all nodes. It can’t do this if there is a partition between any two nodes in the system, and therefore can’t deliver fault tolerance.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a>, <a href="https://mariadb.org">MariaDB</a>.</p><h3 id="cp-database"><span class="me-2">CP database</span><a href="#cp-database" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>CP databases enable consistency and partition tolerance, but not availability. When a partition occurs, the system has to <strong>turn off inconsistent nodes until the partition can be fixed</strong>. That’s why they are not 100% available. MongoDB is an example of a CP database. It’s a NoSQL database management system (DBMS) that uses documents for data storage. It’s considered schema-less, which means that it doesn’t require a defined database schema. It’s commonly used in big data and applications running in different locations. The CP system is structured so that there’s only one primary node that receives all of the write requests in a given replica set. Secondary nodes replicate the data in the primary nodes, so if the primary node fails, a secondary node can stand-in. <strong>Example</strong>: <a href="https://www.mongodb.com">MongoDB</a>, <a href="https://hbase.apache.org">Apache HBase</a>.</p><h3 id="ap-database"><span class="me-2">AP database</span><a href="#ap-database" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>AP databases enable availability and partition tolerance, but not consistency. In the event of a partition, all nodes are available, but they’re not all updated. For example, if a user tries to access data from a bad node, they <strong>won’t receive the most up-to-date version of the data</strong>. When the partition is eventually resolved, most AP databases will sync the nodes to ensure consistency across them. Apache Cassandra is an example of an AP database. It’s a NoSQL database with no primary node, meaning that all of the nodes remain available. Cassandra allows for eventual consistency because users can resync their data right after a partition is resolved.</p><p><strong>Example</strong>: <a href="https://cassandra.apache.org">Apache Cassandra</a>, <a href="https://couchdb.apache.org">CouchDB</a>.</p><h3 id="cap-theorem-and-microservices"><span class="me-2">CAP theorem and microservices</span><a href="#cap-theorem-and-microservices" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Microservices are defined as loosely coupled services that can be independently developed, deployed, and maintained.

If you want to create a microservices application, you can use the CAP theorem to help you determine a database that will best fit your needs.</p><h1 id="pacelc-theorem">PACELC Theorem</h1><p>The PACELC theorem is an extension of the CAP theorem. The CAP theorem states that in the case of network partitioning (P) in a distributed system, one has to choose between Availability (A) and Consistency (C).</p><p>PACELC extends the CAP theorem by introducing latency (L) as an additional attribute of a distributed system. The theorem states that else (E), even when the system is running normally in the absence of partitions, one has to choose between latency (L) and consistency (C).</p><p><em>The PACELC theorem was first described by <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zxeEF2gAAAAJ">Daniel J.

The operations in a transaction either all succeed, or they all fail. In this way, the notion of a transaction supports data integrity when part of a system fails.

While each approach has its own advantages and disadvantages, it is advised to start with a monolith when building a new system. It is important to understand, that microservices are not a silver bullet instead they solve an organizational problem. Microservices architecture is about your organizational priorities and team as much as it’s about technology.</p><p>Before making the decision to move to microservices architecture, you need to ask yourself questions like:</p><ul><li><em>“Is the team too large to work effectively on a shared codebase?”</em><li><em>“Are teams blocked on other teams?”</em><li><em>“Does microservices deliver clear business value for us?”</em><li><em>“Is my business mature enough to use microservices?”</em><li><em>“Is our current architecture limiting us with communication overhead?”</em></ul><p>If your application does not require to be broken down into microservices, you don’t need this. There is no absolute necessity that all applications should be broken down into microservices.</p><p>We frequently draw inspiration from companies such as Netflix and their use of microservices, but we overlook the fact that we are not Netflix. They went through a lot of iterations and models before they had a market-ready solution, and this architecture became acceptable for them when they identified and solved the problem they were trying to tackle.</p><p>That’s why it’s essential to understand in-depth if your business <em>actually</em> needs microservices.

It’s sometimes referred to as a contract between an information provider and an information user establishing the content required from the producer and the content required by the consumer.</p><p>In other words, if you want to interact with a computer or system to retrieve information or perform a function, an API helps you communicate what you want to that system so it can understand and complete the request.</p><h2 id="rest"><span class="me-2">REST</span><a href="#rest" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>A <a href="https://www.ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm">REST API</a> (also known as RESTful API) is an application programming interface that conforms to the constraints of REST architectural style and allows for interaction with RESTful web services. REST stands for Representational State Transfer and it was first introduced by <a href="https://roy.gbiv.com">Roy Fielding</a> in the year 2000.</p><p><em>In REST API, the fundamental unit is a resource.</em></p><h3 id="concepts"><span class="me-2">Concepts</span><a href="#concepts" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Let’s discuss some concepts of a RESTful API.</p><p><strong>Constraints</strong></p><p>In order for an API to be considered <em>RESTful</em>, it has to conform to these architectural constraints:</p><ul><li><strong>Uniform Interface</strong>: There should be a uniform way of interacting with a given server.<li><strong>Client-Server</strong>: A client-server architecture managed through HTTP.<li><strong>Stateless</strong>: No client context shall be stored on the server between requests.<li><strong>Cacheable</strong>: Every response should include whether the response is cacheable or not and for how much duration responses can be cached at the client-side.<li><strong>Layered system</strong>: An application architecture needs to be composed of multiple layers.<li><strong>Code on demand</strong>: Return executable code to support a part of your application. <em>(optional)</em></ul><p><strong>HTTP Verbs</strong></p><p>HTTP defines a set of request methods to indicate the desired action to be performed for a given resource. Although they can also be nouns, these request methods are sometimes referred to as <em>HTTP verbs</em>.

In large-scale systems, rate limiting is commonly used to protect underlying services and resources. Rate limiting is generally used as a defensive mechanism in distributed systems, so that shared resources can maintain availability. It also protects our APIs from unintended or malicious overuse by limiting the number of requests that can reach our API in a given period of time.</p><p><a href="/assets/img/system-design/rate-limiting.jpg" class="popup img-link shimmer"><img src="/assets/img/system-design/rate-limiting.jpg" alt="rate-limiting" loading="lazy"></a></p><h2 id="why-do-we-need-rate-limiting"><span class="me-2">Why do we need Rate Limiting?</span><a href="#why-do-we-need-rate-limiting" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Rate limiting is a very important part of any large-scale system and it can be used to accomplish the following:</p><ul><li>Avoid resource starvation as a result of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.<li>Rate Limiting helps in controlling operational costs by putting a virtual cap on the auto-scaling of resources which if not monitored might lead to exponential bills.<li>Rate limiting can be used as defense or mitigation against some common attacks.<li>For APIs that process massive amounts of data, rate limiting can be used to control the flow of that data.</ul><h2 id="algorithms"><span class="me-2">Algorithms</span><a href="#algorithms" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>There are various algorithms for API rate limiting, each with its advantages and disadvantages. Let’s briefly discuss some of these algorithms:</p><h3 id="leaky-bucket"><span class="me-2">Leaky Bucket</span><a href="#leaky-bucket" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Leaky Bucket is an algorithm that provides a simple, intuitive approach to rate limiting via a queue. When registering a request, the system appends it to the end of the queue. Processing for the first item on the queue occurs at a regular interval or first-in, first-out (FIFO). If the queue is full, then additional requests are discarded (or leaked).</p><h3 id="token-bucket"><span class="me-2">Token Bucket</span><a href="#token-bucket" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Here we use a concept of a <em>bucket</em>. When a request comes in, a token from the bucket must be taken and processed. The request will be refused if no token is available in the bucket, and the requester will have to try again later. As a result, the token bucket gets refreshed after a certain time period.</p><h3 id="fixed-window"><span class="me-2">Fixed Window</span><a href="#fixed-window" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>The system uses a window size of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">n</code> seconds to track the fixed window algorithm rate. Each incoming request increments the counter for the window. It discards the request if the counter exceeds a threshold.</p><h3 id="sliding-log"><span class="me-2">Sliding Log</span><a href="#sliding-log" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Sliding Log rate-limiting involves tracking a time-stamped log for each request. The system stores these logs in a time-sorted hash set or table. It also discards logs with timestamps beyond a threshold. When a new request comes in, we calculate the sum of logs to determine the request rate. If the request would exceed the threshold rate, then it is held.</p><h3 id="sliding-window"><span class="me-2">Sliding Window</span><a href="#sliding-window" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Sliding Window is a hybrid approach that combines the fixed window algorithm’s low processing cost and the sliding log’s improved boundary conditions. Like the fixed window algorithm, we track a counter for each fixed window. Next, we account for a weighted value of the previous window’s request rate based on the current timestamp to smooth out bursts of traffic.</p><h2 id="rate-limiting-in-distributed-systems"><span class="me-2">Rate Limiting in Distributed Systems</span><a href="#rate-limiting-in-distributed-systems" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Rate Limiting becomes complicated when distributed systems are involved. The two broad problems that come with rate limiting in distributed systems are:</p><h3 id="inconsistencies"><span class="me-2">Inconsistencies</span><a href="#inconsistencies" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>When using a cluster of multiple nodes, we might need to enforce a global rate limit policy. Because if each node were to track its rate limit, a consumer could exceed a global rate limit when sending requests to different nodes. The greater the number of nodes, the more likely the user will exceed the global limit.</p><p>The simplest way to solve this problem is to use sticky sessions in our load balancers so that each consumer gets sent to exactly one node but this causes a lack of fault tolerance and scaling problems. Another approach might be to use a centralized data store like <a href="https://redis.io">Redis</a> but this will increase latency and cause race conditions.</p><h3 id="race-conditions"><span class="me-2">Race Conditions</span><a href="#race-conditions" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>This issue happens when we use a naive <em>“get-then-set”</em> approach, in which we retrieve the current rate limit counter, increment it, and then push it back to the datastore. This model’s problem is that additional requests can come through in the time it takes to perform a full cycle of read-increment-store, each attempting to store the increment counter with an invalid (lower) counter value. This allows a consumer to send a very large number of requests to bypass the rate limiting controls.</p><p>One way to avoid this problem is to use some sort of distributed locking mechanism around the key, preventing any other processes from accessing or writing to the counter. Though the lock will become a significant bottleneck and will not scale well. A better approach might be to use a <em>“set-then-get”</em> approach, allowing us to quickly increment and check counter values without letting the atomic operations get in the way.</p><h1 id="service-discovery">Service Discovery</h1><p>Service discovery is the detection of services within a computer network.

Therefore, it can offer a built-in layer of permission that asks a user to agree to what the service provider might access. Although SAML is also capable of allowing consent flow, it achieves this by hard-coding carried out by a developer and not as part of its protocol.</p><p><em>Both of these authentication protocols are good at what they do.

SSL was created to correct this problem and protect user privacy. By encrypting any data that goes between the user and a web server, SSL also stops certain kinds of cyber attacks by preventing attackers from tampering with data in transit.</p><h2 id="tls"><span class="me-2">TLS</span><a href="#tls" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Transport Layer Security, or TLS, is a widely adopted security protocol designed to facilitate privacy and data security for communications over the internet. TLS evolved from a previous encryption protocol called Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). A primary use case of TLS is encrypting the communication between web applications and servers.</p><p>There are three main components to what the TLS protocol accomplishes:</p><ul><li><strong>Encryption</strong>: hides the data being transferred from third parties.<li><strong>Authentication</strong>: ensures that the parties exchanging information are who they claim to be.<li><strong>Integrity</strong>: verifies that the data has not been forged or tampered with.</ul><h2 id="mtls"><span class="me-2">mTLS</span><a href="#mtls" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Mutual TLS, or mTLS, is a method for mutual authentication. mTLS ensures that the parties at each end of a network connection are who they claim to be by verifying that they both have the correct private key.

Because someone with a lot of practical experience will approach it quite differently from someone who’s new in the industry. As a result, it’s hard to come up with a single strategy that will help us stay organized during the interview.</p><p>Let’s look at some common strategies for the system design interviews:</p><h2 id="requirements-clarifications"><span class="me-2">Requirements clarifications</span><a href="#requirements-clarifications" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>System design interview questions, by nature, are vague or abstract. Asking questions about the exact scope of the problem, and clarifying functional requirements early in the interview is essential. Usually, requirements are divided into three parts:</p><h3 id="functional-requirements"><span class="me-2">Functional requirements</span><a href="#functional-requirements" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>These are the requirements that the end user specifically demands as basic functionalities that the system should offer. All these functionalities need to be necessarily incorporated into the system as part of the contract.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>“What are the features that we need to design for this system?”<li>“What are the edge cases we need to consider, if any, in our design?”</ul><h3 id="non-functional-requirements"><span class="me-2">Non-functional requirements</span><a href="#non-functional-requirements" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>These are the quality constraints that the system must satisfy according to the project contract. The priority or extent to which these factors are implemented varies from one project to another. They are also called non-behavioral requirements. For example, portability, maintainability, reliability, scalability, security, etc.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>“Each request should be processed with the minimum latency”<li>“System should be highly available”</ul><h3 id="extended-requirements"><span class="me-2">Extended requirements</span><a href="#extended-requirements" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>These are basically “nice to have” requirements that might be out of the scope of the system.</p><p>For example:</p><ul><li>“Our system should record metrics and analytics”<li>“Service health and performance monitoring?”</ul><h2 id="estimation-and-constraints"><span class="me-2">Estimation and Constraints</span><a href="#estimation-and-constraints" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Estimate the scale of the system we’re going to design.

Doing so in the early stages of the interview would help us to understand the data flow which is the core of every system. In this step, we basically define all the entities and relationships between them.</p><ul><li>“What are the different entities in the system?”<li>“What are the relationships between these entities?”<li>“How many tables do we need?”<li>“Is NoSQL a better choice here?”</ul><h2 id="api-design"><span class="me-2">API design</span><a href="#api-design" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>Next, we can start designing APIs for the system. These APIs will help us define the expectations from the system explicitly. We don’t have to write any code, just a simple interface defining the API requirements such as parameters, functions, classes, types, entities, etc.</p><p>For example:</p><div class="language-tsx highlighter-rouge"><div class="code-header"> <span data-label-text="Tsx"><i class="fas fa-code fa-fw small"></i></span> <button aria-label="copy" data-title-succeed="Copied!"><i class="far fa-clipboard"></i></button></div><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

We can use these 32 hexadecimal digits for generating 7 characters long URL.</p>\[MD5(original\_url) \rightarrow base62encode \rightarrow hash\]<p>However, this creates a new issue for us, which is duplication and collision. We can try to re-compute the hash until we find a unique one but that will increase the overhead of our systems. It’s better to look for more scalable approaches.</p><p><strong>Counter Approach</strong></p><p>In this approach, we will start with a single server which will maintain the count of the keys generated. Once our service receives a request, it can reach out to the counter which returns a unique number and increments the counter. When the next request comes the counter again returns the unique number and this goes on.</p>\[Counter(0-3.5 \space trillion) \rightarrow base62encode \rightarrow hash\]<p>The problem with this approach is that it can quickly become a single point for failure. And if we run multiple instances of the counter we can have collision as it’s essentially a distributed system.</p><p>To solve this issue we can use a distributed system manager such as <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org">Zookeeper</a> which can provide distributed synchronization. Zookeeper can maintain multiple ranges for our servers.</p>\[\begin{align*} &amp; Range \space 1: \space 1 \rightarrow 1,000,000 \\ &amp; Range \space 2: \space 1,000,001 \rightarrow 2,000,000 \\ &amp; Range \space 3: \space 2,000,001 \rightarrow 3,000,000 \\ &amp; ... \end{align*}\]<p>Once a server reaches its maximum range Zookeeper will assign an unused counter range to the new server. This approach can guarantee non-duplicate and collision-resistant URLs. Also, we can run multiple instances of Zookeeper to remove the single point of failure.</p><h3 id="key-generation-service-kgs"><span class="me-2">Key Generation Service (KGS)</span><a href="#key-generation-service-kgs" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>As we discussed, generating a unique key at scale without duplication and collisions can be a bit of a challenge. To solve this problem, we can create a standalone Key Generation Service (KGS) that generates a unique key ahead of time and stores it in a separate database for later use. This approach can make things simple for us.</p><p><strong>How to handle concurrent access?</strong></p><p>Once the key is used, we can mark it in the database to make sure we don’t reuse it, however, if there are multiple server instances reading data concurrently, two or more servers might try to use the same key.</p><p>The easiest way to solve this would be to store keys in two tables. As soon as a key is used, we move it to a separate table with appropriate locking in place. Also, to improve reads, we can keep some of the keys in memory.</p><p><strong>KGS database estimations</strong></p><p>As per our discussion, we can generate up to ~56.8 billion unique 6 character long keys which will result in us having to store 300 GB of keys.</p>\[6 \space characters \times 56.8 \space billion = \sim 390 \space GB\]<p>While 390 GB seems like a lot for this simple use case, it is important to remember this is for the entirety of our service lifetime and the size of the keys database would not increase like our main database.</p><h3 id="caching-1"><span class="me-2">Caching</span><a href="#caching-1" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Now, let’s talk about <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/caching">caching</a>. As per our estimations, we will require around ~35 GB of memory per day to cache 20% of the incoming requests to our services. For this use case, we can use <a href="https://redis.io">Redis</a> or <a href="https://memcached.org">Memcached</a> servers alongside our API server.</p><p><em>For more details, refer to <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/caching">caching</a>.</em></p><h3 id="design"><span class="me-2">Design</span><a href="#design" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Now that we have identified some core components, let’s do the first draft of our system design.</p><p><a href="/assets/img/system-design/url-shortener-basic-design.jpg" class="popup img-link shimmer"><img src="/assets/img/system-design/url-shortener-basic-design.jpg" alt="url-shortener-basic-design" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>Here’s how it works:</p><p><strong>Creating a new URL</strong></p><ol><li>When a user creates a new URL, our API server requests a new unique key from the Key Generation Service (KGS).<li>Key Generation Service provides a unique key to the API server and marks the key as used.<li>API server writes the new URL entry to the database and cache.<li>Our service returns an HTTP 201 (Created) response to the user.</ol><p><strong>Accessing a URL</strong></p><ol><li>When a client navigates to a certain short URL, the request is sent to the API servers.<li>The request first hits the cache, and if the entry is not found there then it is retrieved from the database and an HTTP 301 (Redirect) is issued to the original URL.<li>If the key is still not found in the database, an HTTP 404 (Not found) error is sent to the user.</ol><h2 id="detailed-design-1"><span class="me-2">Detailed design</span><a href="#detailed-design-1" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>It’s time to discuss the finer details of our design.</p><h3 id="data-partitioning-1"><span class="me-2">Data Partitioning</span><a href="#data-partitioning-1" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>To scale out our databases we will need to partition our data. Horizontal partitioning (aka <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/sharding">Sharding</a>) can be a good first step. We can use partitions schemes such as:</p><ul><li>Hash-Based Partitioning<li>List-Based Partitioning<li>Range Based Partitioning<li>Composite Partitioning</ul><p>The above approaches can still cause uneven data and load distribution, we can solve this using <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/consistent-hashing">Consistent hashing</a>.</p><p><em>For more details, refer to <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/sharding">Sharding</a> and <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/consistent-hashing">Consistent Hashing</a>.</em></p><h3 id="database-cleanup"><span class="me-2">Database cleanup</span><a href="#database-cleanup" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>This is more of a maintenance step for our services and depends on whether we keep the expired entries or remove them. If we do decide to remove expired entries, we can approach this in two different ways:</p><p><strong>Active cleanup</strong></p><p>In active cleanup, we will run a separate cleanup service which will periodically remove expired links from our storage and cache. This will be a very lightweight service like a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron job</a>.</p><p><strong>Passive cleanup</strong></p><p>For passive cleanup, we can remove the entry when a user tries to access an expired link. This can ensure a lazy cleanup of our database and cache.</p><h3 id="cache-1"><span class="me-2">Cache</span><a href="#cache-1" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Now let us talk about <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/caching">caching</a>.</p><p><strong>Which cache eviction policy to use?</strong></p><p>As we discussed before, we can use solutions like <a href="https://redis.io">Redis</a> or <a href="https://memcached.org">Memcached</a> and cache 20% of the daily traffic but what kind of cache eviction policy would best fit our needs?</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)">Least Recently Used (LRU)</a> can be a good policy for our system.

Each service will have ownership of its own data model. Let’s try to divide our system into some core services.</p><p><strong>User Service</strong></p><p>This is an HTTP-based service that handles user-related concerns such as authentication and user information.</p><p><strong>Chat Service</strong></p><p>The chat service will use WebSockets and establish connections with the client to handle chat and group message-related functionality. We can also use cache to keep track of all the active connections sort of like sessions which will help us determine if the user is online or not.</p><p><strong>Notification Service</strong></p><p>This service will simply send push notifications to the users. It will be discussed in detail separately.</p><p><strong>Presence Service</strong></p><p>The presence service will keep track of the last seen status of all users. It will be discussed in detail separately.</p><p><strong>Media service</strong></p><p>This service will handle the media (images, videos, files, etc.) uploads. It will be discussed in detail separately.</p><p><strong>What about inter-service communication and service discovery?</strong></p><p>Since our architecture is microservices-based, services will be communicating with each other as well. Generally, REST or HTTP performs well but we can further improve the performance using <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/rest-graphql-grpc#grpc">gRPC</a> which is more lightweight and efficient.</p><p><a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/service-discovery">Service discovery</a> is another thing we will have to take into account. We can also use a service mesh that enables managed, observable, and secure communication between individual services.</p><p><em>Note: Learn more about <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/rest-graphql-grpc">REST, GraphQL, gRPC</a> and how they compare with each other.</em></p><h3 id="real-time-messaging"><span class="me-2">Real-time messaging</span><a href="#real-time-messaging" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>How do we efficiently send and receive messages? We have two different options:</p><p><strong>Pull model</strong></p><p>The client can periodically send an HTTP request to servers to check if there are any new messages. This can be achieved via something like <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/long-polling-websockets-server-sent-events#long-polling">Long polling</a>.</p><p><strong>Push model</strong></p><p>The client opens a long-lived connection with the server and once new data is available it will be pushed to the client. We can use <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/long-polling-websockets-server-sent-events#websockets">WebSockets</a> or <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/long-polling-websockets-server-sent-events#server-sent-events-sse">Server-Sent Events (SSE)</a> for this.</p><p>The pull model approach is not scalable as it will create unnecessary request overhead on our servers and most of the time the response will be empty, thus wasting our resources. To minimize latency, using the push model with <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/long-polling-websockets-server-sent-events#websockets">WebSockets</a> is a better choice because then we can push data to the client once it’s available without any delay given the connection is open with the client. Also, WebSockets provide full-duplex communication, unlike <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/long-polling-websockets-server-sent-events#server-sent-events-sse">Server-Sent Events (SSE)</a> which are only unidirectional.</p><p><em>Note: Learn more about <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/long-polling-websockets-server-sent-events">Long polling, WebSockets, Server-Sent Events (SSE)</a>.</em></p><h3 id="last-seen"><span class="me-2">Last seen</span><a href="#last-seen" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>To implement the last seen functionality, we can use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbeat_(computing)">heartbeat</a> mechanism, where the client can periodically ping the servers indicating its liveness. Since this needs to be as low overhead as possible, we can store the last active timestamp in the cache as follows:</p><div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Key<th>Value<tbody><tr><td>User A<td>2022-07-01T14:32:50<tr><td>User B<td>2022-07-05T05:10:35<tr><td>User C<td>2022-07-10T04:33:25</table></div><p>This will give us the last time the user was active. This functionality will be handled by the presence service combined with <a href="https://redis.io">Redis</a> or <a href="https://memcached.org">Memcached</a> as our cache.</p><p>Another way to implement this is to track the latest action of the user, once the last activity crosses a certain threshold, such as <em>“user hasn’t performed any action in the last 30 seconds”</em>, we can show the user as offline and last seen with the last recorded timestamp. This will be more of a lazy update approach and might benefit us over heartbeat in certain cases.</p><h3 id="notifications"><span class="me-2">Notifications</span><a href="#notifications" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Once a message is sent in a chat or a group, we will first check if the recipient is active or not, we can get this information by taking the user’s active connection and last seen into consideration.</p><p>If the recipient is not active, the chat service will add an event to a <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/message-queues">message queue</a> with additional metadata such as the client’s device platform which will be used to route the notification to the correct platform later on.</p><p>The notification service will then consume the event from the message queue and forward the request to <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging">Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)</a> or <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications">Apple Push Notification Service (APNS)</a> based on the client’s device platform (Android, iOS, web, etc). We can also add support for email and SMS.</p><p><strong>Why are we using a message queue?</strong></p><p>Since most message queues provide best-effort ordering which ensures that messages are generally delivered in the same order as they’re sent and that a message is delivered at least once which is an important part of our service functionality.</p><p>While this seems like a classic <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/publish-subscribe">publish-subscribe</a> use case, it is actually not as mobile devices and browsers each have their own way of handling push notifications. Usually, notifications are handled externally via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) unlike message fan-out which we commonly see in backend services. We can use something like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs">Amazon SQS</a> or <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com">RabbitMQ</a> to support this functionality.</p><h3 id="read-receipts"><span class="me-2">Read receipts</span><a href="#read-receipts" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Handling read receipts can be tricky, for this use case we can wait for some sort of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acknowledgement_(data_networks)">Acknowledgment (ACK)</a> from the client to determine if the message was delivered and update the corresponding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">deliveredAt</code> field. Similarly, we will mark message the message seen once the user opens the chat and update the corresponding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">seenAt</code> timestamp field.</p><h3 id="design-1"><span class="me-2">Design</span><a href="#design-1" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Now that we have identified some core components, let’s do the first draft of our system design.</p><p><a href="/assets/img/system-design/whatsapp-basic-design.jpg" class="popup img-link shimmer"><img src="/assets/img/system-design/whatsapp-basic-design.jpg" alt="whatsapp-basic-design" loading="lazy"></a></p><h2 id="detailed-design-2"><span class="me-2">Detailed design</span><a href="#detailed-design-2" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>It’s time to discuss our design decisions in detail.</p><h3 id="data-partitioning-2"><span class="me-2">Data Partitioning</span><a href="#data-partitioning-2" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>To scale out our databases we will need to partition our data. Horizontal partitioning (aka <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/sharding">Sharding</a>) can be a good first step. We can use partitions schemes such as:</p><ul><li>Hash-Based Partitioning<li>List-Based Partitioning<li>Range Based Partitioning<li>Composite Partitioning</ul><p>The above approaches can still cause uneven data and load distribution, we can solve this using <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/consistent-hashing">Consistent hashing</a>.</p><p><em>For more details, refer to <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/sharding">Sharding</a> and <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/consistent-hashing">Consistent Hashing</a>.</em></p><h3 id="caching-2"><span class="me-2">Caching</span><a href="#caching-2" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>In a messaging application, we have to be careful about using cache as our users expect the latest data, but many users will be requesting the same messages, especially in a group chat. So, to prevent usage spikes from our resources we can cache older messages.</p><p>Some group chats can have thousands of messages and sending that over the network will be really inefficient, to improve efficiency we can add pagination to our system APIs. This decision will be helpful for users with limited network bandwidth as they won’t have to retrieve old messages unless requested.</p><p><strong>Which cache eviction policy to use?</strong></p><p>We can use solutions like <a href="https://redis.io">Redis</a> or <a href="https://memcached.org">Memcached</a> and cache 20% of the daily traffic but what kind of cache eviction policy would best fit our needs?</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)">Least Recently Used (LRU)</a> can be a good policy for our system. In this policy, we discard the least recently used key first.</p><p><strong>How to handle cache miss?</strong></p><p>Whenever there is a cache miss, our servers can hit the database directly and update the cache with the new entries.</p><p><em>For more details, refer to <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/caching">Caching</a>.</em></p><h3 id="media-access-and-storage"><span class="me-2">Media access and storage</span><a href="#media-access-and-storage" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>As we know, most of our storage space will be used for storing media files such as images, videos, or other files. Our media service will be handling both access and storage of the user media files.</p><p>But where can we store files at scale? Well, <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/storage#object-storage">object storage</a> is what we’re looking for. Object stores break data files up into pieces called objects. It then stores those objects in a single repository, which can be spread out across multiple networked systems. We can also use distributed file storage such as <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/storage#hdfs">HDFS</a> or <a href="https://www.gluster.org">GlusterFS</a>.</p><p><em>Fun fact: WhatsApp deletes media on its servers once it has been downloaded by the user.</em></p><p>We can use object stores like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon S3</a>, <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/storage/blobs">Azure Blob Storage</a>, or <a href="https://cloud.google.com/storage">Google Cloud Storage</a> for this use case.</p><h3 id="content-delivery-network-cdn-1"><span class="me-2">Content Delivery Network (CDN)</span><a href="#content-delivery-network-cdn-1" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p><a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/content-delivery-network">Content Delivery Network (CDN)</a> increases content availability and redundancy while reducing bandwidth costs. Generally, static files such as images, and videos are served from CDN. We can use services like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront">Amazon CloudFront</a> or <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/cdn">Cloudflare CDN</a> for this use case.</p><h3 id="api-gateway-1"><span class="me-2">API gateway</span><a href="#api-gateway-1" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Since we will be using multiple protocols like HTTP, WebSocket, TCP/IP, deploying multiple L4 (transport layer) or L7 (application layer) type load balancers separately for each protocol will be expensive.

Each service will have ownership of its own data model. Let’s try to divide our system into some core services.</p><p><strong>User Service</strong></p><p>This service handles user-related concerns such as authentication and user information.</p><p><strong>Newsfeed Service</strong></p><p>This service will handle the generation and publishing of user newsfeeds. It will be discussed in detail separately.</p><p><strong>Tweet Service</strong></p><p>The tweet service will handle tweet-related use cases such as posting a tweet, favorites, etc.</p><p><strong>Search Service</strong></p><p>The service is responsible for handling search-related functionality. It will be discussed in detail separately.</p><p><strong>Media service</strong></p><p>This service will handle the media (images, videos, files, etc.) uploads. It will be discussed in detail separately.</p><p><strong>Notification Service</strong></p><p>This service will simply send push notifications to the users.</p><p><strong>Analytics Service</strong></p><p>This service will be used for metrics and analytics use cases.</p><p><strong>What about inter-service communication and service discovery?</strong></p><p>Since our architecture is microservices-based, services will be communicating with each other as well. Generally, REST or HTTP performs well but we can further improve the performance using <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/rest-graphql-grpc#grpc">gRPC</a> which is more lightweight and efficient.</p><p><a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/service-discovery">Service discovery</a> is another thing we will have to take into account. We can also use a service mesh that enables managed, observable, and secure communication between individual services.</p><p><em>Note: Learn more about <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/rest-graphql-grpc">REST, GraphQL, gRPC</a> and how they compare with each other.</em></p><h3 id="newsfeed"><span class="me-2">Newsfeed</span><a href="#newsfeed" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>When it comes to the newsfeed, it seems easy enough to implement, but there are a lot of things that can make or break this feature. So, let’s divide our problem into two parts:</p><p><strong>Generation</strong></p><p>Let’s assume we want to generate the feed for user A, we will perform the following steps:</p><ol><li>Retrieve the IDs of all the users and entities (hashtags, topics, etc.) user A follows.<li>Fetch the relevant tweets for each of the retrieved IDs.<li>Use a ranking algorithm to rank the tweets based on parameters such as relevance, time, engagement, etc.<li>Return the ranked tweets data to the client in a paginated manner.</ol><p>Feed generation is an intensive process and can take quite a lot of time, especially for users following a lot of people. To improve the performance, the feed can be pre-generated and stored in the cache, then we can have a mechanism to periodically update the feed and apply our ranking algorithm to the new tweets.</p><p><strong>Publishing</strong></p><p>Publishing is the step where the feed data is pushed according to each specific user. This can be a quite heavy operation, as a user may have millions of friends or followers. To deal with this, we have three different approaches:</p><ul><li>Pull Model (or Fan-out on load)</ul><p><a href="/assets/img/system-design/newsfeed-pull-model.jpg" class="popup img-link shimmer"><img src="/assets/img/system-design/newsfeed-pull-model.jpg" alt="newsfeed-pull-model" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>When a user creates a tweet, and a follower reloads their newsfeed, the feed is created and stored in memory. The most recent feed is only loaded when the user requests it. This approach reduces the number of write operations on our database.</p><p>The downside of this approach is that the users will not be able to view recent feeds unless they “pull” the data from the server, which will increase the number of read operations on the server.</p><ul><li>Push Model (or Fan-out on write)</ul><p><a href="/assets/img/system-design/newsfeed-push-model.jpg" class="popup img-link shimmer"><img src="/assets/img/system-design/newsfeed-push-model.jpg" alt="newsfeed-push-model" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>In this model, once a user creates a tweet, it is “pushed” to all the follower’s feeds immediately. This prevents the system from having to go through a user’s entire followers list to check for updates.</p><p>However, the downside of this approach is that it would increase the number of write operations on the database.</p><ul><li>Hybrid Model</ul><p>A third approach is a hybrid model between the pull and push model. It combines the beneficial features of the above two models and tries to provide a balanced approach between the two.</p><p>The hybrid model allows only users with a lesser number of followers to use the push model and for users with a higher number of followers celebrities, the pull model will be used.</p><h3 id="ranking-algorithm"><span class="me-2">Ranking Algorithm</span><a href="#ranking-algorithm" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>As we discussed, we will need a ranking algorithm to rank each tweet according to its relevance to each specific user.</p><p>For example, Facebook used to utilize an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EdgeRank">EdgeRank</a> algorithm, here, the rank of each feed item is described by:</p>\[Rank = Affinity \times Weight \times Decay\]<p>Where,</p><p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Affinity</code>: is the “closeness” of the user to the creator of the edge. If a user frequently likes, comments, or messages the edge creator, then the value of affinity will be higher, resulting in a higher rank for the post.</p><p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Weight</code>: is the value assigned according to each edge. A comment can have a higher weightage than likes, and thus a post with more comments is more likely to get a higher rank.</p><p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Decay</code>: is the measure of the creation of the edge. The older the edge, the lesser will be the value of decay and eventually the rank.</p><p>Nowadays, algorithms are much more complex and ranking is done using machine learning models which can take thousands of factors into consideration.</p><h3 id="retweets"><span class="me-2">Retweets</span><a href="#retweets" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Retweets are one of our extended requirements. To implement this feature we can simply create a new tweet with the user id of the user retweeting the original tweet and then modify the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">type</code> enum and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">content</code> property of the new tweet to link it with the original tweet.</p><p>For example, the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">type</code> enum property can be of type tweet, similar to text, video, etc and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">content</code> can be the id of the original tweet. Here the first row indicates the original tweet while the second row is how we can represent a retweet.</p><div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>id<th>userID<th>type<th>content<th>createdAt<tbody><tr><td>ad34-291a-45f6-b36c<td>7a2c-62c4-4dc8-b1bb<td>text<td>Hey, this is my first tweet…<td>1658905644054<tr><td>f064-49ad-9aa2-84a6<td>6aa2-2bc9-4331-879f<td>tweet<td>ad34-291a-45f6-b36c<td>1658906165427</table></div><p>This is a very basic implementation, to improve this we can create a separate table itself to store retweets.</p><h3 id="search"><span class="me-2">Search</span><a href="#search" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Sometimes traditional DBMS are not performant enough, we need something which allows us to store, search, and analyze huge volumes of data quickly and in near real-time and give results within milliseconds. <a href="https://www.elastic.co">Elasticsearch</a> can help us with this use case.</p><p><a href="https://www.elastic.co">Elasticsearch</a> is a distributed, free and open search and analytics engine for all types of data, including textual, numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured. It is built on top of <a href="https://lucene.apache.org">Apache Lucene</a>.</p><p><strong>How do we identify trending topics?</strong></p><p>Trending functionality will be based on top of the search functionality. We can cache the most frequently searched queries, hashtags, and topics in the last <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">N</code> seconds and update them every <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">M</code> seconds using some sort of batch job mechanism. Our ranking algorithm can also be applied to the trending topics to give them more weight and personalize them for the user.</p><h3 id="notifications-1"><span class="me-2">Notifications</span><a href="#notifications-1" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Push notifications are an integral part of any social media platform. We can use a message queue or a message broker such as <a href="https://kafka.apache.org">Apache Kafka</a> with the notification service to dispatch requests to <a href="https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging">Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)</a> or <a href="https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications">Apple Push Notification Service (APNS)</a> which will handle the delivery of the push notifications to user devices.</p><p><em>For more details, refer to the <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/whatsapp#notifications">WhatsApp</a> system design where we discuss push notifications.</em></p><h2 id="detailed-design-3"><span class="me-2">Detailed design</span><a href="#detailed-design-3" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h2><p>It’s time to discuss our design decisions in detail.</p><h3 id="data-partitioning-3"><span class="me-2">Data Partitioning</span><a href="#data-partitioning-3" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>To scale out our databases we will need to partition our data. Horizontal partitioning (aka <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/sharding">Sharding</a>) can be a good first step. We can use partitions schemes such as:</p><ul><li>Hash-Based Partitioning<li>List-Based Partitioning<li>Range Based Partitioning<li>Composite Partitioning</ul><p>The above approaches can still cause uneven data and load distribution, we can solve this using <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/consistent-hashing">Consistent hashing</a>.</p><p><em>For more details, refer to <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/sharding">Sharding</a> and <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/consistent-hashing">Consistent Hashing</a>.</em></p><h3 id="mutual-friends"><span class="me-2">Mutual friends</span><a href="#mutual-friends" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>For mutual friends, we can build a social graph for every user. Each node in the graph will represent a user and a directional edge will represent followers and followees. After that, we can traverse the followers of a user to find and suggest a mutual friend. This would require a graph database such as <a href="https://neo4j.com">Neo4j</a> and <a href="https://www.arangodb.com">ArangoDB</a>.</p><p>This is a pretty simple algorithm, to improve our suggestion accuracy, we will need to incorporate a recommendation model which uses machine learning as part of our algorithm.</p><h3 id="metrics-and-analytics-1"><span class="me-2">Metrics and Analytics</span><a href="#metrics-and-analytics-1" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Recording analytics and metrics is one of our extended requirements. As we will be using <a href="https://kafka.apache.org">Apache Kafka</a> to publish all sorts of events, we can process these events and run analytics on the data using <a href="https://spark.apache.org">Apache Spark</a> which is an open-source unified analytics engine for large-scale data processing.</p><h3 id="caching-3"><span class="me-2">Caching</span><a href="#caching-3" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>In a social media application, we have to be careful about using cache as our users expect the latest data. So, to prevent usage spikes from our resources we can cache the top 20% of the tweets.</p><p>To further improve efficiency we can add pagination to our system APIs. This decision will be helpful for users with limited network bandwidth as they won’t have to retrieve old messages unless requested.</p><p><strong>Which cache eviction policy to use?</strong></p><p>We can use solutions like <a href="https://redis.io">Redis</a> or <a href="https://memcached.org">Memcached</a> and cache 20% of the daily traffic but what kind of cache eviction policy would best fit our needs?</p><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU)">Least Recently Used (LRU)</a> can be a good policy for our system. In this policy, we discard the least recently used key first.</p><p><strong>How to handle cache miss?</strong></p><p>Whenever there is a cache miss, our servers can hit the database directly and update the cache with the new entries.</p><p><em>For more details, refer to <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/caching">Caching</a>.</em></p><h3 id="media-access-and-storage-1"><span class="me-2">Media access and storage</span><a href="#media-access-and-storage-1" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>As we know, most of our storage space will be used for storing media files such as images, videos, or other files. Our media service will be handling both access and storage of the user media files.</p><p>But where can we store files at scale? Well, <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/storage#object-storage">object storage</a> is what we’re looking for. Object stores break data files up into pieces called objects. It then stores those objects in a single repository, which can be spread out across multiple networked systems. We can also use distributed file storage such as <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/storage#hdfs">HDFS</a> or <a href="https://www.gluster.org">GlusterFS</a>.</p><h3 id="content-delivery-network-cdn-2"><span class="me-2">Content Delivery Network (CDN)</span><a href="#content-delivery-network-cdn-2" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p><a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/content-delivery-network">Content Delivery Network (CDN)</a> increases content availability and redundancy while reducing bandwidth costs.

Each service will have ownership of its own data model. Let’s try to divide our system into some core services.</p><p><strong>User Service</strong></p><p>This service handles user-related concerns such as authentication and user information.</p><p><strong>Stream Service</strong></p><p>The tweet service will handle video streaming-related functionality.</p><p><strong>Search Service</strong></p><p>The service is responsible for handling search-related functionality. It will be discussed in detail separately.</p><p><strong>Media service</strong></p><p>This service will handle the video uploads and processing. It will be discussed in detail separately.</p><p><strong>Analytics Service</strong></p><p>This service will be used for metrics and analytics use cases.</p><p><strong>What about inter-service communication and service discovery?</strong></p><p>Since our architecture is microservices-based, services will be communicating with each other as well. Generally, REST or HTTP performs well but we can further improve the performance using <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/rest-graphql-grpc#grpc">gRPC</a> which is more lightweight and efficient.</p><p><a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/service-discovery">Service discovery</a> is another thing we will have to take into account. We can also use a service mesh that enables managed, observable, and secure communication between individual services.</p><p><em>Note: Learn more about <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/rest-graphql-grpc">REST, GraphQL, gRPC</a> and how they compare with each other.</em></p><h3 id="video-processing"><span class="me-2">Video processing</span><a href="#video-processing" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>There are so many variables in play when it comes to processing a video. For example, an average data size of two-hour raw 8K footage from a high-end camera can easily be up to 4 TB, thus we need to have some kind of processing to reduce both storage and delivery costs.</p><p>Here’s how we can process videos once they’re uploaded by the content team (or users in YouTube’s case) and are queued for processing in our <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/message-queues">message queue</a>.</p><p><a href="/assets/img/system-design/video-processing-pipeline.jpg" class="popup img-link shimmer"><img src="/assets/img/system-design/video-processing-pipeline.jpg" alt="video-processing-pipeline" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>Let’s discuss how this works:</p><ul><li><strong>File Chunker</strong></ul><p>This is the first step of our processing pipeline. File chunking is the process of splitting a file into smaller pieces called chunks. It can help us eliminate duplicate copies of repeating data on storage, and reduces the amount of data sent over the network by only selecting changed chunks.</p><p>Usually, a video file can be split into equal size chunks based on timestamps but Netflix instead splits chunks based on scenes, this slight variation becomes a huge factor for a better user experience as whenever the client requests a chunk from the server, there is a lower chance of interruption as a complete scene will be retrieved.</p><p><a href="/assets/img/system-design/file-chunking.jpg" class="popup img-link shimmer"><img src="/assets/img/system-design/file-chunking.jpg" alt="file-chunking" loading="lazy"></a></p><ul><li><strong>Content Filter</strong></ul><p>This step checks if the video adheres to the content policy of the platform, this can be pre-approved in the case of Netflix as per the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motion_picture_content_rating_system">content rating</a> of the media or can be strictly enforced like YouTube.</p><p>This entire step is done by a machine learning model which performs copyright, piracy, and NSFW checks. If issues are found, we can push the task to a <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/message-queues#dead-letter-queues">dead-letter queue (DLQ)</a> and someone from the moderation team can do further inspection.</p><ul><li><strong>Transcoder</strong></ul><p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcoding">Transcoding</a> is a process in which the original data is decoded to an intermediate uncompressed format, which is then encoded into the target format. This process uses different <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_codec">codecs</a> to perform bitrate adjustment, image downsampling, or re-encoding the media.</p><p>This results in a smaller size file and a much more optimized format for the target devices. Standalone solutions such as <a href="https://ffmpeg.org">FFmpeg</a> or cloud-based solutions like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/mediaconvert">AWS Elemental MediaConvert</a> can be used to implement this step of the pipeline.</p><ul><li><strong>Quality Conversion</strong></ul><p>This is the last step of the processing pipeline and as the name suggests, this step handles the conversion of the transcoded media from the previous step into different resolutions such as 4K, 1440p, 1080p, 720p, etc.</p><p>This allows us to fetch the desired quality of the video as per the user’s request, and once the media file finishes processing, it will be uploaded to a distributed file storage such as <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/storage#hdfs">HDFS</a>, <a href="https://www.gluster.org">GlusterFS</a>, or an <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/storage#object-storage">object storage</a> such as <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3">Amazon S3</a> for later retrieval during streaming.</p><p><em>Note: We can add additional steps such as subtitles and thumbnails generation as part of our pipeline.</em></p><p><strong>Why are we using a message queue?</strong></p><p>Processing videos as a long-running task makes much more sense, and a <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/message-queues">message queue</a> also decouples our video processing pipeline from the uploads functionality. We can use something like <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/sqs">Amazon SQS</a> or <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com">RabbitMQ</a> to support this.</p><h3 id="video-streaming"><span class="me-2">Video streaming</span><a href="#video-streaming" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Video streaming is a challenging task from both the client and server perspectives. Moreover, internet connection speeds vary quite a lot between different users. To make sure users don’t re-fetch the same content, we can use a <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/content-delivery-network">Content Delivery Network (CDN)</a>.</p><p>Netflix takes this a step further with its <a href="https://openconnect.netflix.com">Open Connect</a> program. In this approach, they partner with thousands of Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to localize their traffic and deliver their content more efficiently.</p><p><strong>What is the difference between Netflix’s Open Connect and a traditional Content Delivery Network (CDN)?</strong></p><p>Netflix Open Connect is our purpose-built <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/content-delivery-network">Content Delivery Network (CDN)</a> responsible for serving Netflix’s video traffic. Around 95% of the traffic globally is delivered via direct connections between Open Connect and the ISPs their customers use to access the internet.</p><p>Currently, they have Open Connect Appliances (OCAs) in over 1000 separate locations around the world. In case of issues, Open Connect Appliances (OCAs) can failover, and the traffic can be re-routed to Netflix servers.</p><p>Additionally, we can use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_bitrate_streaming">Adaptive bitrate streaming</a> protocols such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Live_Streaming">HTTP Live Streaming (HLS)</a> which is designed for reliability and it dynamically adapts to network conditions by optimizing playback for the available speed of the connections.</p><p>Lastly, for playing the video from where the user left off (part of our extended requirements), we can simply use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">offset</code> property we stored in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">views</code> table to retrieve the scene chunk at that particular timestamp and resume the playback for the user.</p><h3 id="searching"><span class="me-2">Searching</span><a href="#searching" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Sometimes traditional DBMS are not performant enough, we need something which allows us to store, search, and analyze huge volumes of data quickly and in near real-time and give results within milliseconds. <a href="https://www.elastic.co">Elasticsearch</a> can help us with this use case.</p><p><a href="https://www.elastic.co">Elasticsearch</a> is a distributed, free and open search and analytics engine for all types of data, including textual, numerical, geospatial, structured, and unstructured.

To minimize latency, using the push model with <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/long-polling-websockets-server-sent-events#websockets">WebSockets</a> is a better choice because then we can push data to the client once it’s available without any delay given the connection is open with the client. Also, WebSockets provide full-duplex communication, unlike <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/long-polling-websockets-server-sent-events#server-sent-events-sse">Server-Sent Events (SSE)</a> which are only unidirectional.</p><p>Additionally, the client application should have some sort of background job mechanism to ping GPS location while the application is in the background.</p><p><em>Note: Learn more about <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/long-polling-websockets-server-sent-events">Long polling, WebSockets, Server-Sent Events (SSE)</a>.</em></p><h3 id="ride-matching"><span class="me-2">Ride Matching</span><a href="#ride-matching" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>We need a way to efficiently store and query nearby drivers. Let’s explore different solutions we can incorporate into our design.</p><p><strong>SQL</strong></p><p>We already have access to the latitude and longitude of our customers, and with databases like <a href="https://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</a> and <a href="https://www.mysql.com">MySQL</a> we can perform a query to find nearby driver locations given a latitude and longitude (X, Y) within a radius (R).</p><div class="language-sql highlighter-rouge"><div class="code-header"> <span data-label-text="Sql"><i class="fas fa-code fa-fw small"></i></span> <button aria-label="copy" data-title-succeed="Copied!"><i class="far fa-clipboard"></i></button></div><div class="highlight"><code><table class="rouge-table"><tbody><tr><td class="rouge-gutter gl"><pre class="lineno">1

</pre></table></code></div></div><p>However, this is not scalable, and performing this query on large datasets will be quite slow.</p><p><strong>Geohashing</strong></p><p>Geohashing is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_geocoding">geocoding</a> method used to encode geographic coordinates such as latitude and longitude into short alphanumeric strings. It was created by <a href="https://twitter.com/gniemeyer">Gustavo Niemeyer</a> in 2008.</p><p>Geohash is a hierarchical spatial index that uses Base-32 alphabet encoding, the first character in a geohash identifies the initial location as one of the 32 cells. This cell will also contain 32 cells. This means that to represent a point, the world is recursively divided into smaller and smaller cells with each additional bit until the desired precision is attained. The precision factor also determines the size of the cell.</p><p><a href="/assets/img/system-design/geohashing.jpg" class="popup img-link shimmer"><img src="/assets/img/system-design/geohashing.jpg" alt="geohashing" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>For example, San Francisco with coordinates <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">37.7564, -122.4016</code> can be represented in geohash as <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">9q8yy9mf</code>.</p><p>Now, using the customer’s geohash we can determine the nearest available driver by simply comparing it with the driver’s geohash. For better performance, we will index and store the geohash of the driver in memory for faster retrieval.</p><p><strong>Quadtrees</strong></p><p>A Quadtree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. They are often used to partition a two-dimensional space by recursively subdividing it into four quadrants or regions. Each child or leaf node stores spatial information. Quadtrees are the two-dimensional analog of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octree">Octrees</a> which are used to partition three-dimensional space.</p><p><a href="/assets/img/system-design/quadtree.jpg" class="popup img-link shimmer"><img src="/assets/img/system-design/quadtree.jpg" alt="quadtree" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>Quadtrees enable us to search points within a two-dimensional range efficiently, where those points are defined as latitude/longitude coordinates or as cartesian (x, y) coordinates.</p><p>We can save further computation by only subdividing a node after a certain threshold.</p><p><a href="/assets/img/system-design/quadtree-subdivision.jpg" class="popup img-link shimmer"><img src="/assets/img/system-design/quadtree-subdivision.jpg" alt="quadtree-subdivision" loading="lazy"></a></p><p>Quadtree seems perfect for our use case, we can update the Quadtree every time we receive a new location update from the driver. To reduce the load on the quadtree servers we can use an in-memory datastore such as <a href="https://redis.io">Redis</a> to cache the latest updates. And with the application of mapping algorithms such as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_curve">Hilbert curve</a>, we can perform efficient range queries to find nearby drivers for the customer.</p><p><strong>What about race conditions?</strong></p><p>Race conditions can easily occur when a large number of customers will be requesting rides simultaneously. To avoid this, we can wrap our ride matching logic in a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lock_(computer_science)">Mutex</a> to avoid any race conditions. Furthermore, every action should be transactional in nature.</p><p><em>For more details, refer to <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/transactions">Transactions</a> and <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/distributed-transactions">Distributed Transactions</a>.</em></p><p><strong>How to find the best drivers nearby?</strong></p><p>Once we have a list of nearby drivers from the Quadtree servers, we can perform some sort of ranking based on parameters like average ratings, relevance, past customer feedback, etc. This will allow us to broadcast notifications to the best available drivers first.</p><p><strong>Dealing with high demand</strong></p><p>In cases of high demand, we can use the concept of Surge Pricing. Surge pricing is a dynamic pricing method where prices are temporarily increased as a reaction to increased demand and mostly limited supply. This surge price can be added to the base price of the trip.</p><p><em>For more details, learn how <a href="https://www.uber.com/us/en/drive/driver-app/how-surge-works">surge pricing works</a> with Uber.</em></p><h3 id="payments"><span class="me-2">Payments</span><a href="#payments" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Handling payments at scale is challenging, to simplify our system we can use a third-party payment processor like <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a> or <a href="https://www.paypal.com">PayPal</a>. Once the payment is complete, the payment processor will redirect the user back to our application and we can set up a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webhook">webhook</a> to capture all the payment-related data.</p><h3 id="notifications-2"><span class="me-2">Notifications</span><a href="#notifications-2" class="anchor text-muted"><i class="fas fa-hashtag"></i></a></h3><p>Push notifications will be an integral part of our platform.

Horizontal partitioning (aka <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/sharding">Sharding</a>) can be a good first step. We can shard our database either based on existing <a href="https://karanpratapsingh.com/courses/system-design/sharding#partitioning-criteria">partition schemes</a> or regions. If we divide the locations into regions using let’s say zip codes, we can effectively store all the data in a given region on a fixed node.
