There are several libraries in Python for parsing URLs:

urllib: This is a standard library in Python, and it includes several modules for working with URLs and HTTP requests, including urllib.parse which provides functions for parsing URLs.

urlparse: This is another standard library in Python, and it provides similar functionality as urllib.parse.

furl: This is a third-party library for parsing and manipulating URLs. It provides a more user-friendly interface than the standard libraries and supports features like query string parsing and modification.

requests-furl: This library is an add-on for the requests library, and it provides URL parsing and manipulation functionality similar to furl.

py-url-parse: This is another third-party library for parsing URLs, and it provides a simple and lightweight interface for parsing URLs into their constituent parts.

All of these libraries can be used to parse URLs into their constituent parts, such as the scheme, host, path, query string, and fragment. You can choose the one that best fits your needs based on your requirements for features, ease of use, and performance.
