There are several Python libraries that can be used for manipulating audio and its metadata, including:

1. **pydub:** pydub is a high-level library for audio manipulation. It allows you to load audio from a variety of sources (including MP3, WAV, and FLAC files), perform operations on the audio (such as slicing, concatenating, and exporting), and work with the metadata associated with the audio.

2. **librosa:** librosa is a library for audio analysis and manipulation. It provides functions for loading audio from disk, computing features like Mel spectrograms and MFCCs, and manipulating the audio signal in various ways. It also includes functions for working with audio metadata, such as extracting song titles and artist information.

3. **audioread:** audioread is a library for decoding audio files of various formats, including MP3, FLAC, and WAV. It provides a simple, unified interface for reading audio data from a variety of file formats, and it can also extract metadata from the audio files, such as the length of the audio, the sample rate, and the number of channels.

4. **mutagen:** mutagen is a library for reading and writing metadata in a variety of audio file formats, including MP3, FLAC, and Ogg Vorbis. It provides a simple and flexible interface for working with audio metadata, and it supports a wide range of metadata fields, including album art, lyrics, and album and track information.

5. **soundfile:** soundfile is a library for reading and writing audio files of various formats, including WAV, AIFF, and FLAC. It provides a simple and efficient interface for reading and writing audio data, and it includes support for working with the metadata associated with the audio files, such as the sample rate and number of channels.

These are just a few examples of the many libraries available for working with audio and its metadata in Python. The best library for your needs will depend on the requirements of your specific project, as well as your personal preferences and experience.
