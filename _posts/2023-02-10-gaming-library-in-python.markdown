There are several libraries in Python that can be used for game development, including:

Pygame: This is a popular library for game development in Python. It provides a simple and easy-to-use set of tools for creating 2D games and other types of interactive applications.

Arcade: This is a library for creating 2D video games and other interactive applications in Python. It provides a high-level API for creating games and other interactive applications, making it a great choice for beginners.

Pyglet: This is a cross-platform library for game and multimedia development in Python. It provides a powerful and flexible set of tools for creating games and other interactive applications, including support for 2D and 3D graphics.

Kivy: This is an open-source library for developing mobile and desktop games in Python. It provides a high-level API for creating games and other interactive applications, and it supports multiple platforms, including Android, iOS, and Windows.

PyOpenGL: This is a library for developing 3D games and other interactive applications in Python. It provides a low-level API for creating 3D graphics and animations, and it is often used in conjunction with other game development libraries, such as Pygame or Pyglet.

All of these libraries have their own strengths and weaknesses, so it's important to evaluate each one to see which one is the best fit for your needs. Consider factors such as the ease of use, available features, and overall performance when choosing a gaming library in Python.
