Single Sign-On (SSO) works by creating a central authentication service that is responsible for verifying the identity of a user. When a user attempts to access an application or service that is part of the SSO solution, they are redirected to the SSO service, which authenticates the user. If the user's identity is verified, the SSO service generates a token that represents the user's identity and includes information about the user's session and the resources they are authorized to access.

The token is then sent back to the application or service the user was trying to access, and the application uses the information in the token to determine whether the user is authorized to access the requested resources. If the user is authorized, the application grants access to the resources, and the user can perform the tasks they need to do.

One of the key benefits of SSO is that once a user has logged in to the SSO service, they are automatically logged in to all of the other applications and services that are part of the SSO solution. This eliminates the need for the user to enter their credentials for each individual system, making it easier and more convenient for the user to access the resources they need.

In summary, SSO works by creating a central authentication service that verifies the identity of a user and generates a token representing the user's identity. The token is used by the applications and services to determine whether the user is authorized to access the requested resources, and the user is automatically logged in to all systems that are part of the SSO solution. This eliminates the need for the user to enter their credentials for each individual system, making it more convenient and secure for the user to access the resources they need.
