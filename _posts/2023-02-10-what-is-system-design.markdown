System design is a process of defining the architecture, modules, interfaces, data for a system to satisfy specified requirements. It can refer to the design of a complex system, such as a computer network, an aircraft, or a power plant, or it can refer to the design of a smaller system, such as a software application or a single computer program.

The goal of system design is to produce a blueprint or plan that outlines how all the components of the system will work together to achieve the desired outcomes. This process typically involves analyzing the requirements of the system, defining the architecture, selecting appropriate technologies, and ensuring that the system is scalable, maintainable, and meets performance, reliability, and security requirements.

In software engineering, system design is often used as a synonym for software design, which is the process of defining the architecture, modules, interfaces, and data for a software system to satisfy specified requirements.
